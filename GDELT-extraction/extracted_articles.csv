20240430,cnn,Samsung reports enormous jump in profit on AI boom,"Samsung Electronics forecast demand for artificial intelligence would hold strong and tighten supply of some high-end chips, joining rivals in benefiting from a solid rebound in the battered global memory chip market. The upbeat outlook from the world’s largest memory chip maker sent its shares 1.8% higher on Tuesday after it reported a more than 10-fold rise in first-quarter operating profit. But so far this year Samsung shares are down 0.8%, lagging SK Hynix’s 24% gain, as it seeks to catch up with its smaller rival in the supply of top-end chips such as high bandwidth memory (HBM) to AI leader Nvidia (NVDA). “We plan to increase supply of HBM-related chips in 2024 by more than three-fold versus last year,” Jaejune Kim, a Samsung vice president in charge of the memory division, said on an earnings call. Samsung said it began mass production this month of the latest HBM chips for use in generative AI chipsets, called 8-layer HBM3E. It is seeking to capitalize on the AI boom that has benefited SK Hynix, which had been the sole supplier of HBM3 chips to Nvidia. Samsung said it planned to start making the 12-layer version during the second quarter, and expected the latest HBM3E products to account for two-thirds of its HBM output by year-end. Analysts said the targets were aggressive. Samsung’s 8-layer HBM3E appears to be supplying Nvidia, while the 12-layer may go to AMD (AMD) and Nvidia, said Jeff Kim, head of research at KB Securities. “As Samsung’s technology is advantageous for high-stacking, while SK Hynix has its advantages in the 8-layer, there may be a segmentation where Nvidia gets 12-layer products from Samsung and most 8-layer products from SK Hynix,” Kim said. “Samsung is working hard to improve the yield of its 12-layer product,” he added. Samsung did not respond immediately to a request for comment on its HBM customers. Samsung also said it will step up offerings of high-end solid-state drive (SSD) products to meet AI server demand, and expected high-end memory chip supply to become tighter toward year-end due to capacity being focused on HBM, echoing comments from SK Hynix last week. Jump in operating profit The South Korean company’s first-quarter revenue rose 13% to 71.9 trillion won ($52.14 billion), including a 96% increase in memory chip revenue to 17.49 trillion won as prices rose steeply from a severe downturn, partly thanks to the boom in AI. Operating profit rose to 6.6 trillion won in January to March, up from 640 billion won a year earlier. It was the company’s highest operating profit since the third quarter of 2022. The chip division, historically Samsung’s cash cow business that used to account for two-thirds of its operating profit, swung to a profit of 1.91 trillion won in the March quarter from a 4.58 trillion won loss a year earlier. It was the first profit since the third quarter of 2022. Prices of NAND flash chips used to store data increased by 23% to 28% during the first quarter versus the previous quarter, while prices of DRAM chips used in tech devices rose by about 20%, according to data provider TrendForce. Samsung’s mobile devices business booked a 3.51 trillion won operating profit in the first quarter, down from 3.94 trillion won a year earlier. It shipped about 60 million smartphones during the quarter, in line with a year earlier but retaking its title as the world’s top smartphone vendor from Apple (AAPL), which is suffering a sales decline in China. Rising costs, including increased memory chip prices, dented margins from its flagship Galaxy S24 smartphones launched during the quarter. Samsung said AI functions were driving sales of S24 phones, allowing the division to maintain double-digit profitability in the first quarter. About 50% of customers said they bought S24 phones for the AI functions, and 60% were regularly using the AI functions, the company said."
20240430,cbsnews,"Chicago Tribune, other major newspapers accuse artificial intelligence companies of stealing content","A group of major newspaper publishers, including the Chicago Tribune and New York Daily News, are accusing two of the biggest artificial intelligence companies of stealing their content to improve their products.That accusation comes in a civil lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court in New York. The lawsuit targets two of the biggest generative AI platforms in the world, Open AI, the creators of ChatGPT, and Microsoft's Copilot AI program. What is AI's threat to local news? The plaintiffs argue that the development of the internet and the theft of their content is the biggest threat to local news.The suit claims Open AI and Microsoft pay for computers, technical infrastructure, programmers, and other tech workers but not for the newspapers' information used to train their models to generate the content they create. ""Despite admitting that they need copyrighted content to produce a commercially viable GenAI product, the defendants contend they can fuel the creation and operation of these products with the Publishers' content without permission or paying for the privilege.""They are wrong on both counts.""Examples of AI allegedly stealing contentThe lawsuit cited several examples of ChatGPT and Copilot returning verbatim articles from the Chicago Tribune and other publications in response to a user's question on the platform. The newspaper publishers want the companies to compensate them for ""their unlawful use of protected newspaper content to date.""The lawsuit seeks unspecified statutory damages, compensatory damages, and restitution. Artificial intelligence has been touted for various uses, from helping fight wildfires to filling a shortage of mental health professionals.However, it also has been known to serve up wildly inaccurate information about elections.The Associated Press reported that Microsoft declined to comment Tuesday. OpenAI didn't immediately respond to a request for comment to the AP.In addition to the Tribune and Daily News, the other publishers named as plaintiffs are The Orlando Sentinel, South Florida Sun-Sentinel, San Jose Mercury-News, DP Media Network, ORB Publishing, and Northwest Publications."
