20200625,foxnews,"Lasers, AI and drones likely to inform Navy concept for new 2030 destroyer","Maybe it will take out missiles beyond the earth’s atmosphere, incinerate targets well beyond the horizon with high-powered laser weapons and instantly stop a multi-faceted series of incoming attacks all at the same time? Perhaps it will use AI-empowered algorithms to launch a large fleet of networked surface, air and undersea drones, able to launch coordinated attacks at long ranges? All of these capabilities, advanced well beyond the current state-of-the-art into a new generation of maritime warfare weapons, are likely to figure prominently in the Navy’s current conceptual work on a new generation of destroyers to emerge more than a decade from now –&nbsp;the Future Surface Combatant. It may be far too early for the U.S. Navy to cultivate any kind of integrated picture of what its Future Surface Combatant may ultimately look like, given that the ship is not anticipated to arrive until the 2030s. However, the Navy’s plan for a new generation of destroyers invites consideration of certain key technical trends and tactical goals likely agreed upon by Navy futurists now exploring conceptual work on the ship. A few things can unequivocally be understood, by virtue of Navy strategies, plans and current modernization activities. The service plans to extend its successful fleet of DDG 51 Arleigh Burke-class destroyers for many years to come, and it seems clear that current near-term modernization trends are likely to shape any conceptual approach to 2030. Many elements of the existing Zumwalt-class and DDG 51Flight III destroyers arguably inform the conceptual foundation of what the Navy envisions for a new generation of destroyers. There are what might be considered somewhat self-evident areas of focus, such as power-scaling lasers, and newer networked command and control for the operation of ocean drones. Other considerations include advances in radar sensitivity, such as the SPY6 and EW, and laying the technical foundation to accommodate a new generation of emerging weapons. Perhaps of most critical importance, cyber hardening and the expansion of AI-empowered computer systems. As for stealth, that seems like very much of an open question, as it seems that it would be challenging to merge some of the stealthy characteristics of Zumwalt with the massively armed Flight III DDG 51 destroyers. After all, DDG 51s rely upon a wide range of externally-mounted sensors, antennae, deck-launched weapons and mast configurations. These could certainly be adjusted, it just leaves the question as to how that might impact, or impair some elements of its warfighting capacity. NAVY ARMS SEA DRONES FOR OCEAN ATTACK Several existing areas of technical examination seem to present themselves as areas of likely focus, as they offer a foundation upon which subsequent future systems could be evolved. One obvious weapon is lasers, as there is much room for growth. Current work is geared toward power-scaling and form-factor miniaturization, two trajectories intended to expand the tactical envelope for lasers. Stronger beams, involving the merging of several beams into a single weapon, can destroy larger objects, increase range and vastly improve the effects “scalability” of lasers."
20200916,foxnews,High-tech AI ship launched on Mayflower's 400th anniversary,"The U.S. ambassador to Britain officially launched a ship named Mayflower on Wednesday, marking 400 years&nbsp;after a wooden vessel with the same name sailed from an English port and landed at modern-day&nbsp;Plymouth, Massachusetts. Unlike the&nbsp;merchant ship that carried European settlers across the Atlantic&nbsp;in 1620, Ambassador Robert Wood Johnson's Mayflower has no crew and is steered by&nbsp;artificial intelligence. HISTORIC MAYFLOWER STEPS FOUND UNDER WOMEN'S BATHROOM IN ENGLISH PUB The&nbsp;Mayflower Autonomous Ship is intended to be the first in a new generation of artificially crewed vessels that can explore parts of oceans too dangerous or difficult for humans to reach.&nbsp;It will&nbsp;work with scientists&nbsp;to help better understand climate change, micro-plastic pollution&nbsp;and marine mammal conservation.  According to The Associated Press, the 50-foot&nbsp;trimaran will undergo&nbsp;six months of sea trials and short trips before heading out on its main voyage The high-tech ship was developed jointly by&nbsp;U.K.-based marine research organization ProMare and U.S. tech giant IBM. At a ceremony attended by&nbsp;Dutch Ambassador Karel van Oosterom and Royal Navy Adm. Tony Radakin, Johnson said the venture showed that ""the pioneering spirit of the Mayflower really lives on."" The new Mayflower will travel a similar route to that of its predecessor from&nbsp;Plymouth, England, to Plymouth, Massachusetts. The coronavirus pandemic has delayed its trip until the spring of 2021, and additional commemorations were disrupted, too. As many of the Pilgrims who traveled on the Mayflower had fled England for Holland prior to their voyage, the anniversary plans involve British, American and Dutch institutions, as well as the&nbsp;Wampanoag people, who were the native inhabitants of what is now New England.  Wampanoag stories have been marginalized on past Mayflower anniversaries, but now play a large role in events. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP"
20211208,cnn,How chatbots are being used to train crisis counselors,"Drew, a 21-year-old in Irvine, California, needs help: He’s transgender, and after starting hormone replacement therapy he’s facing harassment from coworkers. It’s gotten so bad, Drew tells a crisis counselor via a text-based chat session, that he’s considering suicide. He can’t quit his job, however, because he needs the money. “i think about killing myself pretty constantly these days,” Drew types. The counselor reassures Drew — thanking him for reaching out to talk, telling him he’s not alone — and draws out details about how Drew plans to kill himself. “Have you done anything today to try to kill yourself?” the counselor asks. After a pause, Drew responds, “no i haven’t done anything today.” It’s a hard conversation to read, even with the knowledge that Drew isn’t a real person, but rather an artificially intelligent chatbot created by The Trevor Project, a suicide prevention and crisis intervention group for LGBTQ youth. While chatbots are often thought of as a necessary (and at times obnoxious) outgrowth of online customer service, Drew’s purpose is far different from helping customers do things like return a pair of pants or get an insurance quote. Drew simulates conversations with volunteer crisis-counselors-in-training who will go on to staff The Trevor Project’s always-available text- and chat-based helplines (the group also has a staffed 24/7 phone line). LGBTQ youth are at a higher risk of depression and suicide than other young people, and research indicates this may have worsened during the pandemic due to factors such as isolation from school closures. The overall training process for new counselors who will respond to texts and chats takes months, and role-playing is a key part of it. The hope is that, with the aid of capable chatbots like Drew, the nonprofit can train many more counselors more quickly than by conducting role-playing sessions staffed by people. “You can watch a lot of training videos and you can read all the handbooks. You can get cognitively how this is supposed to go. But actually doing it and feeling the feelings of being in one of these conversations, even if it’s simulated, is just a different kind of learning experience,” said Dan Fichter, head of AI and engineering for The Trevor Project. Drew and Riley Drew is the second such chatbot the group has rolled out this year — part of what The Trevor Project calls its “Crisis Contact Simulator” — and it deals with more complicated subject matter than its predecessor. The first chatbot, named Riley, represented a depressed North-Carolina teen dealing with issues related to coming out as genderqueer; Riley was created with help and $2.7 million in funding from Google’s charitable arm, Google.org. (Drew was developed internally by The Trevor Project). The Trevor Project said it began using Drew along with Riley in the last couple months, and has trained over 1,000 digital volunteer counselors with the chatbots thus far. It has 1,205 digital counselors in total. In November, The Trevor Project gave CNN Business a peek at"
20210624,cnn,Rembrandt’s ‘Night Watch’ on display with missing figures restored by AI,"For the first time in 300 years, Rembrandt’s famed “The Night Watch” is back on display in what researchers say is its original size, with missing parts temporarily restored in an exhibition aided by artificial intelligence. Rembrandt finished the large canvas, which portrays the captain of an Amsterdam city militia ordering his men into action, in 1642. Although it is now considered one of the greatest masterpieces of the Dutch Golden Age, strips were cut from all four sides of it during a move in 1715. Though those strips have not been found, another artist of the time had made a copy, and restorers and computer scientists have used that, blended with Rembrandt’s style, to recreate the missing parts. “It’s never the real thing, but I think it gives you different insight into the composition,” Rijksmuseum director Taco Dibbits said. The effect is a little like seeing a photo cropped as the photographer would have wanted. The central figure in the painting, Captain Frans Bannink Cocq, now appears more off-center, as he was in Rembrandt’s original version, making the work more dynamic. Some of the figure of a drummer entering the frame on the far right has been restored, as he marches onto the scene, prompting a dog to bark. Three restored figures that had been missing on the left, not highly detailed, are onlookers, not members of the militia. That was an effect Rembrandt intended, Dibbits said, to draw the viewer into the painting. Rijksmuseum Senior Scientist Robert Erdmann explained some of the steps in crafting the missing parts, which are hung to overlap the original work without touching it. First both “The Night Watch” and the much smaller copy, which is attributed to Gerrit Lundens and dated to around 1655, had to be carefully photographed. Then researchers scaled the images to the same size, and warped the Lundens work to fit better with the Rembrandt where there were minor differences in placement of figures and objects. The artificial intelligence software learned by trying millions of times to approximate Rembrandt’s style and colors more closely. Humans judged the success. Erdemann said the result was good enough that the AI had “hallucinated” cracks in the paint in some spots as it translated Lundens work into Rembrandt. But asked whether this is the best possible restoration of “The Night Watch,” he said no. “I think technique will always be able to improve.”"
20201226,cbsnews,"A crewless boat is recreating the Mayflower's 400-year-old journey, with the help of artificial intelligence","The Mayflower carried some of the first European settlers across the Atlantic Ocean to North America, 400 years ago this year. To commemorate the anniversary, another vessel is recreating that voyage, with the help of artificial intelligence. ""We don't know how it's going to go. Is it going to make it across the Atlantic?"" software engineer and emerging technology specialist Rosie Lickorish told CBS News' Roxana Saberi. ""Fingers crossed that it does have a successful first voyage.""The vessel, docked in the harbor of Plymouth, England, will rely on the latest navigation technology when it sets out to sea — but it won't be carrying a crew or captain.""We've got all sorts of cameras… We've got global positioning systems on either side,"" robotics expert Brett Phaneuf said.What it won't have, he said, is ""people space.""Instead the ship will be guided by artificial intelligence designed by IBM.Phaneuf explained how the technology is supposed to work.""It looks at its own cameras like eyes, it looks at the radar, it looks at all sorts of other sensors,"" he said. ""Then it charts its own course and it can deal with unique situations without any human input.""Those situations include encountering other ships during the voyage — something software engineer Ollie Thompson is working hard to train the ship's programming to recognize using more than a million different images.""We're simulating what she's seeing,"" he said of the boat. Programmers are also setting the ship's destination to Plymouth, Massachusetts to retrace the Mayflower's four centuries-old passage. It took the wooden merchant ship 66 days to transport dozens of pilgrims across the Atlantic. A replica sailed from England to Massachusetts in the 1950s, and is still docked there today.But Phenauf, who grew up near Plymouth, Massachusetts, wanted to mark the Mayflower's famous past by looking ahead instead.""I thought, well, we should build a ship that speaks to the next 400 years. What the marine enterprise will look like then, as opposed to what it looked like 400 years ago,"" he said.An international team turned his vision into the solar-and-wind-powered Mayflower autonomous ship. Its mission is to learn more about Earth's oceans by gathering data on plastic pollution, warming waters and their effects on marine life. Software developer Rosie Likorish said the autonomous ship is a more cost-effective way to perform the research.""It's very expensive at the moment for scientists actually go out on these research missions,"" she said. ""So having autonomous vessels like the Mayflower Autonomous Ship is a really important step and kind of actually enabling us to go out to these dangerous places and learn a lot more.""In addition to cost-saving, not having a crew means the size of the vessel can be compact, and there are no concerns over someone getting sick or hurt.Brett Phenauf said his biggest worry would be if something broke. If the boat capsized, the team plans to track it via satellite and salvage it.And if the unknown voyage succeeds, Phenauf says it would commemorate history while charting a new"
20211021,foxnews,"Former Pentagon official 'not surprised' by Chinese launch, says US is running out of time in AI race","The former chief software officer for the U.S. Air Force was ""not surprised"" by China’s&nbsp;nuclear-capable rocket launch and warned that the U.S. ""is running out of time"" to catch up in the artificial intelligence race against China.&nbsp; ""AI is so important to what's coming next in terms of innovation, but also in terms of weapons, quite honestly,"" Nicolas Chaillan told Fox News in an interview.&nbsp; China’s expanding artificial intelligence and tech capabilities are ""an existential threat to our kids and all our friendly nations' kids as well,"" he added. Chaillan served as the chief software officer in the Air Force for three years before announcing his resignation last month, criticizing the Pentagon’s low prioritization of technological innovation on his way out. China in August test-launched two hypersonic missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads, the Financial Times reported. Such projectiles can fly at more than five times the speed of sound – slower than a ballistic missile, but are harder to track and stop. WHITE HOUSE CALLS FOR ‘NEW APPROACH’ TO NATIONAL SECURITY CHALLENGES TO ‘PREVAIL’ IN COMPETITION WITH CHINA The development reportedly surprised U.S. intelligence officials, though the missile missed its target by about two dozen miles. But Chaillan said he was not surprised by the Chinese military's advancement and suggested U.S. military leadership may have more information than it lets on.&nbsp; ""When you look at the launch – that shows the importance of artificial intelligence,"" he told Fox News. ""These missiles are able to move and have a different velocity and be harder to track and to target."" ""The better way and probably the only way to succeed at defending ourselves against these kind of attacks will be through artificial intelligence capabilities,"" Chaillan continued. Chaillan&nbsp;posted a scathing letter on LinkedIn&nbsp;last month when first announcing his resignation. He criticized the Defense Department's lack of agility and accountability. ""While we wasted time in bureaucracy, our adversaries moved further ahead,"" he wrote. Growth in the AI sector is exponential due to its compounding nature, the former Air Force tech officer told Fox News. As China continues to accelerate its development, U.S. agencies stuck behind bureaucratic red tape move at a much slower pace, unable to keep up. He also said the Pentagon is so accustomed to leading on the world’s stage that officials ""get complacent,"" allowing others, like China, to surpass them. He noted that the military wastes taxpayer money on soon-to-be outdated hardware and doesn't invest enough in cybersecurity, tech or AI training.&nbsp; A number of U.S. departments have been subject to hacks and&nbsp;ransomware&nbsp;attacks in recent years. In April 2020, the departments of the Treasury, Homeland Security, State and Defense&nbsp;were compromised in&nbsp;the SolarWinds cyberattack, which gave hackers remote access to spy on the staff's digital activities for months. The cyberattack on the major software company infected more than 18,000 customers with undetected malware.&nbsp; Army Chief Information Officer Raj Iyer dismissed Chaillan’s assessment that the U.S. was losing the technology war against China, saying ""it’s absolutely not true.""&nbsp; ""If you looked"
20200226,cnn,Clearview AI has billions of our photos. Its entire client list was just stolen,"Clearview AI, a startup that compiles billions of photos for facial recognition technology, said it lost its entire client list to hackers.  The company said it has patched the unspecified flaw that allowed the breach to happen. In a statement, Clearview AI’s attorney Tor Ekeland said that while security is the company’s top priority, “unfortunately, data breaches are a part of life. Our servers were never accessed.” He added that the company continues to strengthen its security procedures and that the flaw has been patched.  Clearview AI continues “to work to strengthen our security,” Ekeland said. In a notification sent to customers obtained by Daily Beast, Clearview AI said that an intruder “gained unauthorized access” to its customer list, which includes police forces, law enforcement agencies and banks. The company said that the person didn’t obtain any search histories conducted by customers, which include some police forces.  The company claims to have scraped more than 3 billion photos from the internet, including photos from popular social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube. The firm garnered controversy in January after a New York Times investigation revealed that Clearview AI’s technology allowed law enforcement agencies to use its technology to match photos of unknown faces to people’s online images. The company also retains those photos in its database even after internet users delete them from the platforms or make their accounts private. That prompted cease-and-desist letters from tech giants Twitter

In an interview with CNN Business earlier this month, Clearview AI founder and CEO Hoan Ton-That downplayed concerns about his technology. He said he wants to build a “great American company” with “the best of intentions.” He said he wouldn’t sell his product to Iran, Russia or China and claimed the technology is saving kids and solving crimes.  –CNN Business’ Donie O’Sullivan contributed to this report."
20200426,cbsnews,Outbreak Science: Using artificial intelligence to track the coronavirus pandemic  - 60 Minutes,"When you're fighting a pandemic, almost nothing matters more than speed. A little-known band of doctors and hi-tech wizards say they were able to find the vital speed needed to attack the coronavirus: the computing power of artificial intelligence. They call their new weapon ""outbreak science."" It could change the way we fight another contagion. Already it has led to calls for an overhaul of how the federal government does things. But first, we'll take you inside BlueDot, a small Canadian company with an algorithm that scours the world for outbreaks of infectious disease. It's a digital early warning system, and it was among the first to raise alarms about this lethal outbreak.It was New Year's Eve when BlueDot's computer spat out an alert: a Chinese business paper had just reported 27 cases of a mysterious flu-like disease in Wuhan, a city of 11 million. The signs were ominous. Seven people were already in hospitals.Almost all the cases came from the city's sprawling market, where live animals are packed in cages and slaughtered on-site. Medical detectives are now investigating if this is where the epidemic began, when the virus made the leap from animals to us.Half a world away on the Toronto waterfront, BlueDot's founder and CEO, Dr. Kamran Khan, was on his way to work. An infectious disease physician, he had seen another coronavirus in 2003 – SARS – kill three colleagues. When we spoke with him remotely he told us this outbreak had him worried.Dr. Kamran Khan: We did not know that this would become the next pandemic. But we did know that there were echoes of the SARS outbreak, and it was something that we really should be paying attention to.COVID-19 soon got the world's attention. BlueDot's Toronto staff now works from home, except for Dr. Khan. But in December, the office kicked into high-gear as they rushed to verify the alert.Chinese officials were secretive about what was happening. But BlueDot's computer doesn't rely on official statements. Their algorithm was already churning through data, including medical bulletins, even livestock reports, to predict where the virus would go next.It was also scanning the ticket data from 4,000 airports.BlueDot wasn't just tracking flights, but calculating the cities at greatest risk. On December 31, there were more than 800,000 travellers leaving Wuhan, some likely carrying the disease.Dr. Kamran Khan: So these yellow lines reflect the nonstop flights going out of Wuhan. And then the blue circles reflect the final destinations of travelers. The larger the circle, the larger number of travelers who are going to that location. These were many of the first cities that actually received cases of COVID-19 as it spread out of mainland China.Bill Whitaker: You can do that in a matter of seconds?Dr. Kamran Khan: We can analyze and visualize all this information across the globe in just a few seconds.The virus wasn't just spreading to east Asia. Thousands of travelers were heading to the United States too.Dr. Kamran Khan: Most of the travel came"
20200902,foxnews,Pentagon taps Google for A.I. project to help veterans battling cancer,"EXCLUSIVE –&nbsp;Google&nbsp;announced Wednesday it has been chosen by a sector of the Defense Department&nbsp;to assist with a new U.S. health system designed to help pathologists study and identify&nbsp;certain types of&nbsp;cancers&nbsp;suffered by military&nbsp;veterans. The Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) tasked Google with crafting a specialized artificial-intelligence&nbsp;model of information that could be&nbsp;overlayed with&nbsp;augmented-reality microscopes.&nbsp;Google’s machine intelligence then helps doctors as they use the microscopes to&nbsp;map out the tumor, in an effort to determine its distinct makeup and cellular structure. Vice president of the global public sector for Google Cloud&nbsp;Mike Daniels&nbsp;spoke with Fox News about the program. He said the innovations being rolled out could lead to exciting breakthroughs in cancer research, as well as general health care. “Health care is critical to the military’s force readiness,” Daniels said during a phone interview. “More important than that, or equally important, is funding for certain cancer-related programs. The DHA (Defense Health Agency)&nbsp;spends $1.7 billion of its annual budget on cancer research. “We&nbsp;are hoping by activating A.I. we are able to accomplish two outcomes,” Daniels&nbsp;continued. “One is, better patient outcomes with respect to diagnoses, and two is&nbsp;to create some efficiency to help these pathologists sift through the enormous amount of data they have. It’s an important practical application of A.I. at the point of care, to drive real-world outcomes that matter for our country.” The program, also aimed at helping drive down medical costs, is focusing on both active-duty military members&nbsp;and veterans, to be implemented at DHA treatment facilities and Veterans Affairs hospitals across the U.S. “How it happens is, there is a limited set of military hospitals and VA facilities that have augmented-reality microscopes,” Daniels explained.&nbsp;“We are deploying our already developed model onto those microscopes to literally be&nbsp;a&nbsp;virtual assistant for the pathologist, at the time when they are looking at these slides.” WITH ONLY MONTHS TO LIVE, INDIANA HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR GETS MARRIED IN TOUCH CEREMONY He added that the technology&nbsp;“identifies&nbsp;areas where they might want to look closer, because of an algorithm relay match. ... Our responsibilities will include day-to-day program management, architecture, and technical implementation of that aspect.” Aashima Gupta, the director of&nbsp;global health care solutions for Google Cloud, also spoke with Fox News about the undertaking. She said the level of relief the program will provide&nbsp;practicing pathologists cannot be understated. The program will lighten pathologists’ workloads by lessening the number of hours they must spend on such dense material, freeing them to do a deeper dive into the other aspects of their advanced research,&nbsp;while also expediting the publishing of their findings, Gupta said. “Looking through a pathologist’s microscope and examining the tumor in a patient, that’s the gold standard today,” she said. “They look through the microscope and look into the tissue of the tumor. Looking at the tissue has a profound impact on most of the treatment decisions, but the task is very laborious today and pretty burdensome. “When they’re looking and analyzing tissue, small cells need to be noted and this can be used to determine the stage of the"
20200311,cnn,IBM wants to make computers fluent in human,"IBM is commercializing a new technology that makes it easier for computers to understand human communication. Artificial intelligence systems have taken on a growing role in business as their abilities to process and learn from large quantities of data have improved. But they have struggled to understand the kinds of nuances that appear in everyday communication among people. IBM (IBM) is adding new tools to its AI system, Watson, which can address that problem and better understand human language. The “natural language processing” technology was developed for IBM (IBM) Research’s Project Debater, the AI machine that became the first to compete against a world class human debater last year. To hold its own in a debate, Project Debater needed to have the ability to listen to its opponent, understand his or her argument and formulate a response rapidly, all without internet access. That meant the computer needed to be able to identify and make sense of colloquialisms and idioms — as well as certain dialects or industry-specific terms — such as “open a can of worms” or “hardly helpful” (previously, an AI system might think someone was actually opening a can of worms). Companies will now be able to use IBM’s natural language processing tools to more efficiently and effectively comb through documents and conduct research, field incoming communications and improve customer service. “Everything that happens in a business is based on communication between employees, business partners, customers, and communication takes the form of emails, chats, text, documents,” Rob Thomas, general manager of IBM Data and AI, told CNN Business. “Some of the best data a company has is codified in all that language, all those communications.” Around 48% of global chief investment officers will be looking to deploy AI systems in their companies this year, according to a 2019 survey by research firm Gartner. A January IBM survey of 4,500 “technology decision makers” within companies around the world similarly found that 45% of companies with more than 1,000 employees have adopted AI. One major improvement over existing AI systems is the system’s ability to do “sentiment analysis” — to look at what someone is saying or has written and understand what they are really trying to communicate and what the context is. For example, it could now comprehend that someone saying they have “cold feet” means that they’re apprehensive, not that their limbs are chilly. “A lot of how we talk and interact, certainly in customer support, is using a lot of idioms or terms that are specific to an industry,” Thomas said. When that capability is plugged into an existing IBM AI tool called Watson Discovery, it can also make it easier for companies to dig through and glean insights from troves of documents and other written communications. The system is better able to understand the central themes or important points in documents and classify them into more specific categories, so they’re more useful. It can also generate succinct summaries from mass amounts of data. The tool"
20210716,cbsnews,New Anthony Bourdain documentary includes A.I. imitation of late chef's voice,"A new documentary about Anthony Bourdain, who died in 2018, includes an artificial intelligence version of the chef's voice, raising ethical concerns for some fans. ""Roadrunner"" director Morgan Neville said in an interview with The New Yorker that he used Bourdain's voice from several sources, including TV, radio and podcasts, to narrate the film. However, he wanted to use three quotes that there were no recordings of – one of them being a part where the ""Parts Unknown"" host reads an email he wrote. Neville told the magazine he and his team compiled together about 12 hours worth of recordings and handed it over to a software company, which recreated his voice. ""If you watch the film, other than that line you mentioned, you probably don't know what the other lines are that were spoken by the A.I., and you're not going to know,"" Neville told New Yorker writer Helen Rosner. ""We can have a documentary-ethics panel about it later.""Neville explained his decision to use A.I. in GQ and said he checked in with Bourdain's literary executor and widow.""They were like, Tony would have been cool with that,"" he said. ""I wasn't putting words into his mouth. I was just trying to make them come alive.""Neville said he did not interview Asia Argento, Bourdain's girlfriend at the time of his death. Bourdain's ex-wife, Ottavia Bourdain, responded to Neville's remarks, saying she was ""NOT the one who said Tony would been cool with that."" Some fans were upset over the use of the A.I.-manufactured voice for the film. Screenwriter Ashley Lynch tweeted that it's so ""ethically f****d up on so many levels and is really gross."" ""Anthony Bourdain already had so many good insights and quotable lines why would you feel the need to falsify material?"" one Twitter user said.  ""I definitely disagree with this for one reason. Anthony was not an actor that you could feed lines to and he'd recite them. He had original thoughts that he expressed in his own way,"" another Twitter user said. Bourdain died by suicide three years ago at the age of 61. ""Roadrunner"" explores the complexity elicited by the life and death of the famed chef and TV personality. Neville told ""CBS Sunday Morning"" earlier this month that the film aims to help fans of his grieve. ""I hope the film in some way gets people to start to think of him as a whole person again, to at least process some aspect of his death, but also his life,"" he said. "
20200220,foxnews,Artificial intelligence spotted 11 'potentially hazardous' asteroids that NASA missed,"An asteroid hitting Earth is one of humanity's greatest existential threats, making it imperative that asteroid detection is a vital task for government space agencies around the world. Using advanced artificial intelligence, researchers in the Netherlands have discovered several ""potentially hazardous objects"" that were not spotted by humans. The research, published in Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics, looked at space objects more than 100 meters in diameter that were likely to come within 4.7 million miles of Earth. The AI ran simulations 10,000 years into the future and discovered 11 asteroids that are not on NASA's list of ""potentially hazardous"" near-Earth&nbsp;objects. ""The resulting instrument, named the Hazardous Object Identifier (HOI), was trained on the basis of an artificial set of known impactors which were generated by launching objects from Earth’s surface and integrating them backward in time,"" the researchers wrote in the study's abstract.&nbsp;""HOI was able to identify 95.25 [percent]&nbsp;of the known impactors simulated that were present in the test set as potential impactors. In addition, HOI was able to identify 90.99 [percent]&nbsp;of the potentially hazardous objects identified by NASA, without being trained on them directly."" POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS ASTEROID THAT ZIPPED PAST EARTH HAS ITS OWN 'MOON' ""Potentially hazardous"" NEOs (Near Earth Objects) are defined as space objects that come within 0.05 astronomical units and measure more than 460 feet in diameter,&nbsp;according to NASA. One of the study's co-authors, astronomer and simulation expert Simon Portegies Zwart, said that now that the method works, further research is needed. ""We now know that our method works, but we would certainly like to delve deeper in the research with a better neural network and with more input,"" Zwart said in a statement. ""The tricky part is that small disruptions in the orbit calculations can lead to major changes in the conclusions."" According to a&nbsp;2018 report&nbsp;put together by Planetary.org, there are more than 18,000 NEOs. NASA&nbsp;has been preparing for planetary defense from asteroid strikes for years. A&nbsp;recent survey&nbsp;showed that Americans prefer a space program that focuses on potential&nbsp;asteroid&nbsp;impacts over sending humans back to the&nbsp;moon&nbsp;or to&nbsp;Mars. In April 2019, NASA&nbsp;awarded a $69 million contract to&nbsp;SpaceX, the space exploration company led by Elon Musk, to help it with&nbsp;asteroid deflection&nbsp;via its DART&nbsp;mission. MILE-LONG ASTEROID COULD BE DANGEROUS TO LIFE ON EARTH IN MILLIONS OF YEARS IF IT BREAKS UP: SCIENTISTS NASA has recently expanded its planetary defense protocols, including last year's unveiling of a bold new plan to protect Earth.

20200220,cbsnews,Job hunters face a new hurdle: Impressing AI,"If you're on the hunt for a new job, there's a new twist to the hiring process that's increasingly common: Getting judged by artificial intelligence. Major businesses like Unilever and Ikea are turning to AI programs to sniff out suitable applicants — and predict future job performance — partly as a way to cut down on the time needed to hire employees. Supporters say the tech can help companies find better job candidates and eliminate some of the inherent bias that executives may not even be aware of, such as leaning toward candidates who are white or male.But critics say there are issues with relying on algorithms to make complex decisions. One Princeton professor, Arvind Narayanan, is questioning whether AI can accurately predict job success, calling such claims ""snake oil."" And Electronic Privacy Information Center counsel John Davisson calls the AI programs are a ""nightmarish combination of privacy violations and outcomes that aren't based on any easily understood criteria."" His group earlier this month petitioned the Federal Trade Commission to start regulating AI's use in the job market and other business applications.At stake are the roughly 7 million job openings that employers seek to fill each month. Traditional gatekeepers such as human resources professionals are increasingly turning to AI to review resumes — no small task when employment site Glassdoor says the average job opening receives about 250 resumes. Some are also relying on AI programs to score applicants' video interviews, with the goal of skimming the cream from the top. Some companies say they see results, with one case study from Unilever finding that an AI analysis from a company called HireVue saved the company $1 million by cutting down on the time needed to sort through 250,000 applications. Relying on AI to cull the applicant pool also helped diversify new hires by 16%, it found. Yet the lack of transparency about the inner workings of these AI applications, as well as the vast amount of data they collect, are raising concerns among lawmakers and privacy experts. Of particular concern — that these programs could unfairly evaluate certain types of applicants, such as minorities and women.""It's like anything else — wine, music and food. Some of it is really good and some of it is really bad,"" said Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic, chief talent scientist at staffing and recruitment company ManpowerGroup, which is also an adviser to HireVue. ""The big challenge and question of AI in the world of talent is: Will algorithms be better at knowing us than we do ourselves?""Gaining traction in workplaceSo far, there appears to be more questions than answers, even as the technology gains traction in the workplace. While there's no federal government tracking or oversight of AI, surveys of human resource executives provide insight into AI's usage in the job market. Almost 7 in 10 recruiters and hiring managers told LinkedIn in 2018 that AI applications help them save time, according to a survey of 8,800 executives, while about 4 in 10 said AI"
20200630,foxnews,Army AI-enabled robots may fire weapons in war to defend against attacks,"What if artillery rounds, mini-drone swarms of explosives, rockets and even air-fired missiles are all approaching forward-positioned Army troops at the same time? Imagine that these incoming weapons are dispersed, varied and fast approaching. How do ground commanders avoid being overwhelmed and destroyed? Could AI help solve this lethal predicament? The incoming attacks are fast, multi-faceted and extremely lethal. Ground commanders and armed infantry simply do not have time to respond to all targets simultaneously to discern which ones to intercept. Not only that, but commanders may simply have too many targets to optimize which kind of layered defense might be best suited to counter different approaching weapons. Think about the scenarios going through a commander’s head. Which countermeasure is best? A kinetic interceptor? Electronic warfare? Lasers? These questions would likely need to be addressed, analyzed and answered in real-time, possibly even a matter of seconds, to save lives. “We are trying to merge operationally relevant data at the tactical level by&nbsp;connecting sensor to shooter. What if the shooter is a robot? Do I have to confirm each target?” Dr. Bruce Jette, Assistant Secretary of the Army, Acquisition, Logistics and Technology, told The National Interest in an interview. HOW AI CHANGES ATTACK MISSIONS FOR US FIGHTER JETS AND BOMBERS AI systems can now instantly organize incoming sensor data, perform near-real-time analytics and make determinations regarding the scope of the attack, its range, speed, configuration and approaching trajectory. Perhaps of greatest significance, it could possibly determine which method of defense might be needed. All of these variables are likely to converge so fast that a human commander simply could not respond, placing the Army force, installation or Forward Operating Base at great risk of destruction. Advanced algorithms, however, can synthesize and analyze radar returns, infrared sensor data, navigational details and countermeasures, bounce all of that information off an existing and seemingly limitless database, and present options to human decision-makers immediately. Perhaps larger incoming weapons will need to be destroyed with a kinetic,&nbsp;explosive interceptor&nbsp;such as a Coyote drone? Perhaps a small group of electronically powered mini-drones might be best countered by an EW weapon able to jam the target and throw it off course? Or further, perhaps the combat is in an urban area where explosive fragments might injure civilians, a circumstance which may call for a laser? However, weather obscurants or certain terrain features might preclude the ability for a laser to incinerate approaching targets, requiring a different defensive solution. AI programs can now determine which methods have been effective in the past in varying, yet specific scenarios and present commanders with a series of options. This kind of application, which is now being rapidly advanced by Army scientists, researchers and weapons developers, could bring new dimensions to warfare. It is exactly what Jette envisions. 'FIRST-CUT-OF-STEEL' BEGINS NEW ERA IN NUCLEAR WEAPONS, SUBMARINE WARFARE Jette paralleled this process to an interesting and significant multi-service term called “weapons hold, weapons tight, weapons free.” Weapons Hold, according to a 2002 multi-service&nbsp;“Brevity Code”"
20201206,cnn,Google widely criticized after parting ways with a leading voice in AI ethics,"Many Google employees and others in the tech and academic communities are furious over the sudden exit from Google of a pioneer in the study of ethics in artificial intelligence—a departure they see as a failure by an industry titan to foster an environment supportive of diversity. Timnit Gebru is known for her research into bias and inequality in AI, and in particular for a 2018 paper she coauthored with Joy Buolamwini that highlighted how poorly commercial facial-recognition software fared when attempting to classify women and people of color. Their work sparked widespread awareness of issues common in AI today, particularly when the technology is tasked with identifying anything about human beings. At Google, Gebru was the co-leader of the company’s ethical AI team, and one of very few Black employees at the company overall (3.7% of Google’s employees are Black according to the company’s 2020 annual diversity report)— let alone in its AI division. The research scientist is also cofounder of the group Black in AI. On Wednesday night, Gebru tweeted that she had been “immediately fired” for an email she recently sent to Google’s Brain Women and Allies internal mailing list. In later tweets, Gebru clarified that no one at Google explicitly told her that she was fired. Rather, she said Google would not meet a number of her conditions for returning and accepted her resignation immediately because it felt that her email reflected “behavior that is inconsistent with the expectations of a Google manager.” In the email, which was first published by the newsletter Platformer on Thursday, Gebru wrote that she felt “constantly dehumanized” at Google and expressed dismay over the ongoing lack of diversity at the company. “Because there is zero accountability. There is no incentive to hire 39% women: your life gets worse when you start advocating for underrepresented people, you start making the other leaders upset when they don’t want to give you good ratings during calibration. There is no way more documents or more conversations will achieve anything,” she wrote. Gebru also expressed frustration over an internal process related to the review of a research paper she coauthored with others at Google and outside the company that had not yet been published. The research paper in question Gebru, who joined Google in late 2018, told CNN Business that the research paper in question was about the dangers of large language models — a growing trend in AI with the release of increasingly capable systems that can create impressively human-sounding text like recipes, poetry, and even news articles. This is also an area of AI that Google has shown it feels is key to its future in search. Gebru said the paper had been submitted to the Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency, which will be held in March, and that there was nothing unusual about how the paper was submitted for internal review at Google. She said she wrote the email Tuesday evening after a long back and forth with Google AI"
20210226,cnn,McDonald’s and other chains are giving their drive-thrus the Jetsons treatment,"At a McDonald’s drive-thru in a Chicago suburb, customers may notice something different about the voice that takes their orders for Big Macs and fries. “Welcome to McDonald’s, what can I get for you?” it asks in a welcoming, unmistakably feminine tone. While the voice sounds helpful, it’s also stilted and monotonous enough for the average customer to figure out they’re being served by a computer, not a human. It’s a lot like Alexa or Siri, but for a drive-thru: a system driven by artificial intelligence that McDonald’s is testing out to speed up its service. In 2019 the average McDonald’s drive-thru took six minutes and 18 seconds, but recently the company trimmed that to five minutes and 49 seconds in 2020, according to an annual report from market researcher SeeLevel HX. And with drive-thrus accounting for a larger share of fast-food sales than ever before (in top markets, it’s 70% of sales at McDonald’s), the race is on for major chains to get those speeds even faster. During the pandemic, chains have relied more heavily on sales through their drive-thrus while dining rooms remain closed in many places. Even restaurants like Chipotle, with its rollout of “Chipotlanes,” and Shake Shack, which is opening its first drive-thru this summer, are recognizing their importance. For chains that already had drive-thus, slow service, long lines and inaccurate orders are seen as threats after a year in which sales took a hit at nearly every major chain. McDonald’s, Burger King and White Castle had already been quietly investing in technology like artificial intelligence before 2020, but Covid-19 made those upgrades even more critical. Companies are now experimenting with smart menu boards, Alexa-style assistants, automated ordering and payment processes, and even payments driven by facial recognition. If the 1950s were the golden age of fast food — a decade during which the drive-thru rose to popularity — then the 2020s could be the golden age of drive-thru tech. “Technology is changing the experience, and I think it got thrust into hyper-overdrive by the pandemic,” said Lisa van Kesteren, CEO and founder of SeeLevel HX, which has been analyzing how fast-food restaurants respond to Covid-19. Need for speed McDonald’s, of course, had no idea what was coming in 2020. But as restaurants across the US began shutting down last March due to Covid-19, the company was uniquely positioned to keep feeding customers while barely coming in contact with them: Of the roughly 14,000 McDonald’s locations across the US, nearly 95% include a drive-thru lane, which gives it more fast-food roadways than any of its competitors. Before the pandemic, the company focused on improving its overall drive-thru experience — over the past couple years McDonald’s has cut its service time by about 30 seconds per customer, helped in part by a simpler menu. But in March, when Covid forced closures across multiple industries, it made even more aggressive cuts — a change that franchise owners said could ensure “blazing fast service”. All-day breakfast was out."
20210309,cbsnews,Immigrant rights groups sue facial-recognition company Clearview AI,"Two immigrant-rights groups in California are suing Clearview AI, claiming the face-recognition company violates privacy laws by building the largest database of human faces in the nation and providing law enforcement with the database even in cities that have banned facial recognition. ""Clearview has provided thousands of governments, government agencies and private entities access to its database, which they can use to identify people with dissident views, monitor their associations and track their speech,"" claims the lawsuit, filed on Tuesday in Alameda County superior court. Clearview, a tech startup founded in 2017, has amassed 3 billion photos of people pulled from social networks such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and Venmo — usually without the people's knowledge or consent. The company has fielded requests from more than 2,200 law-enforcement agencies and private companies, and its database is larger than the FBI's, the lawsuit claims. Most recently, the company has seen a spike in use as law enforcement tracks down participants in January 6's violent protest at the U.S. Capitol, the New York Times reported.But this surveillance also erodes privacy protections, ""making it impossible to walk down the street without fear your likeness can be captured, stored indefinitely by the company, and used against you any time in the future,"" said Sejal Zota, a lead attorney in the case. The plaintiffs are the immigrant rights groups Mijente and Norcal Resist, as well as four activists living in California. The four have been outwardly supportive of Black Lives Matter and critical of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement — stances that open them up to retaliation by police agencies that use Clearview, the lawsuit contends.""Clearview allows anyone with access to its database to capture a single photo of an individual, and with a few keystrokes, to determine the identity of the person and their personal details in real time — as they shop in the grocery store, attend a political rally or walk down the street,"" the lawsuit claims. Clearview contends its conduct is protected by the First Amendment, and last year hired prominent attorney Floyd Abrams to represent it. The company faces lawsuits in Illinois, where a privacy law forbids using biometric information like voice prints or face scans without consent, and in Vermont. ""Fully protected by First Amendment"" Asked for comment on the Alameda lawsuit, a Clearview spokesperson forwarded a comment from Abrams: ""Clearview AI complies with all applicable law and its conduct is fully protected by the First Amendment,"" the comment said. Clearview has previously compared itself to Google, which trawls the entire internet to serve up information on individuals that might be incriminating or embarrassing. Multiple cities around the country, including many in the Bay Area, have banned the use of face-recognition technology by government agencies or by law enforcement. Tuesday's lawsuit claims that Clearview continues to peddle its services despite these law-enforcement bans. Simply by virtue of using social media to communicate with friends and family, these activists open themselves up to biometric monitoring and processing, the lawsuit"
20200812,cbsnews,Facebook touts use of artificial intelligence to help detect harmful content and misinformation,"Confronted with an onslaught of social media posts filled with misinformation and harmful content, Facebook said Tuesday it has begun to rely on artificial intelligence to boost its efforts to evaluate whether posts violate its policies and should be labeled or removed. AI is being used to rank content on its platforms involving self-harm, sexual exploitation, and hate speech. However, content will still be evaluated by human moderators, regardless of whether the offending posts are reported by users or detected by the company's proactive systems. Guy Rosen, Facebook's vice president of integrity, told reporters on a call Tuesday that the company would be shifting toward ""more content being initially actioned by our automated systems,"" but would continue to rely on humans to review posts and train artificial intelligence. Facebook came under fire earlier this summer when it decided to leave up a post from President Trump that appeared to incite violence in the wake of protests following George Floyd's death in Minneapolis. On May 29, Mr. Trump posted on Twitter and Facebook that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" Twitter hid the tweet and instead displayed a warning that said the message was ""glorifying violence."" Facebook neither removed nor added context to the post. Although some Facebook employees criticized the decision not to label or remove the post, CEO Mark Zuckerberg defended the decision. ""We looked very closely at the post that discussed the protests in Minnesota to evaluate whether it violated our policies,"" Zuckerberg wrote in a statement on Facebook. ""Our policy around incitement of violence allows for discussion around state use of force, although today's situation raises important questions about what potential limits of that discussion should be,"" he added. According to its Community Standards Enforcement Report, Facebook took action against 22.2 million posts that included hate speech between April and June, an increase from 9.6 million posts in the previous three months. Ninety-five percent of the more than 22 million posts with hate speech were initially flagged by AI. Rosen attributed the increase to the expanded application of the automated systems to posts in other languages, including Spanish, Arabic, and Indonesian. The number of posts related to terrorism that Facebook took action against increased from 6.3 million in the first three months of the year to 8.7 million in second quarter. But relying on automated systems poses a big risk, says Emma Llanso, director of the Free Expression Project at the Center for Democracy and Technology. ""Every type of content moderation has a risk of error but when we are talking about automated systems, that risk is multiplied enormously because you are using automated detection tools on every piece of content that's on a service,"" Llanso said. There is a danger that such a system may be too broad. Because content moderation led by AI involves ""essentially filtering out everyone's content"" and exposing ""everyone's posts to some kind of judgment,"" Llanso said the approach ""creates a lot of risks for free expression and privacy.""

20201120,cbsnews,New York City wants to restrict artificial intelligence in hiring,"New York City is trying to rein in the use of algorithms used to screen job applicants. It's one of the first cities in the U.S. to try to regulate what is an increasingly common — and opaque — hiring practice. The city council is considering a bill that would require potential employers to notify job candidates about the use of these tools, referred to as ""automated decision systems."" Companies would also have to complete an annual audit to make sure the technology doesn't result in bias.The move comes as the use of artificial intelligence in hiring skyrockets, increasingly replacing human screeners. Fortune 500 companies including Delta, Dunkin, Ikea and Unilever have turned to AI for help assessing job applicants. These tools run the gamut from a simple text reader that screens applications for particular words and phrases, to a system that evaluates videos of potential applicants to judge their suitability for the job.""We have all the reasons to believe that every major company uses some algorithmic hiring,"" Julia Stoyanovich, a founding director of the Center for Responsible AI at New York University, said in a recent webinar. Machine biasAt a time when New Yorkers are suffering double-digit unemployment, legislators are concerned about the brave new world of digital hiring. Research has shown that AI systems can introduce more problems than they solve. Facial-recognition tools that use AI have demonstrated trouble in identifying faces of Black people, determining people's sex and wrongly matching members of Congress to a mugshot database. In perhaps the most notorious example of AI bias, a hiring tool developed internally at Amazon had to be scrapped because it discriminated against women. The tool was developed using a 10-year history of resumes submitted to the company, whose workforce skews male. As a result, the software effectively ""taught"" itself that male candidates were preferable and demoted applications that included the word ""women,"" or the names of two all-women's colleges. While the tool was never used, it demonstrates the potential pitfalls of substituting machine intelligence for human judgment. ""As legislators in a city home to some of the world's largest corporations, we must intervene and prevent unjust hiring,"" city council member Laurie Cumbo, the bill's sponsor, said at a hearing for the legislation last week. Not tough enoughSeveral civil rights groups say New York's proposed bill doesn't go far enough. A dozen groups including the AI Now Institute, New York Civil Liberties Union and New York Communities for Change issued a letter last week pushing for the law to cover more types of automated tools and more steps in the hiring process. They want the measure to include heavier penalties, enabling people to sue if they've been passed over for a job because of biased algorithms. This would be in line with existing employment law, which allows applicants to sue for discrimination because of race or sex.""If we pass [the bill] as it is worded today, it will be a rubber stamp for some of the worst forms"
20200427,cbsnews,Outbreak Science: Using artificial intelligence to track the coronavirus pandemic  - 60 Minutes,"When you're fighting a pandemic, almost nothing matters more than speed. A little-known band of doctors and hi-tech wizards say they were able to find the vital speed needed to attack the coronavirus: the computing power of artificial intelligence. They call their new weapon ""outbreak science."" It could change the way we fight another contagion. Already it has led to calls for an overhaul of how the federal government does things. But first, we'll take you inside BlueDot, a small Canadian company with an algorithm that scours the world for outbreaks of infectious disease. It's a digital early warning system, and it was among the first to raise alarms about this lethal outbreak.It was New Year's Eve when BlueDot's computer spat out an alert: a Chinese business paper had just reported 27 cases of a mysterious flu-like disease in Wuhan, a city of 11 million. The signs were ominous. Seven people were already in hospitals.Almost all the cases came from the city's sprawling market, where live animals are packed in cages and slaughtered on-site. Medical detectives are now investigating if this is where the epidemic began, when the virus made the leap from animals to us.Half a world away on the Toronto waterfront, BlueDot's founder and CEO, Dr. Kamran Khan, was on his way to work. An infectious disease physician, he had seen another coronavirus in 2003 – SARS – kill three colleagues. When we spoke with him remotely he told us this outbreak had him worried.Dr. Kamran Khan: We did not know that this would become the next pandemic. But we did know that there were echoes of the SARS outbreak, and it was something that we really should be paying attention to.COVID-19 soon got the world's attention. BlueDot's Toronto staff now works from home, except for Dr. Khan. But in December, the office kicked into high-gear as they rushed to verify the alert.Chinese officials were secretive about what was happening. But BlueDot's computer doesn't rely on official statements. Their algorithm was already churning through data, including medical bulletins, even livestock reports, to predict where the virus would go next.It was also scanning the ticket data from 4,000 airports.BlueDot wasn't just tracking flights, but calculating the cities at greatest risk. On December 31, there were more than 800,000 travellers leaving Wuhan, some likely carrying the disease.Dr. Kamran Khan: So these yellow lines reflect the nonstop flights going out of Wuhan. And then the blue circles reflect the final destinations of travelers. The larger the circle, the larger number of travelers who are going to that location. These were many of the first cities that actually received cases of COVID-19 as it spread out of mainland China.Bill Whitaker: You can do that in a matter of seconds?Dr. Kamran Khan: We can analyze and visualize all this information across the globe in just a few seconds.The virus wasn't just spreading to east Asia.

20210105,foxnews,"6th-gen stealth fighter likely to include lasers, AI and drone control","A stealthy, supersonic, semi-autonomous sixth-generation fighter maneuvers undetected through heavily armed enemy air space, evades radar detection to jam the adversary’s command and control systems with EW (Electronic Warfare) weapons, gather, analyze and transmit targeting data across huge areas of terrain in milliseconds using AI-empowered computing … then the fighter is able to launch and operate groups of nearby mini-drones, fire air-launched hypersonic missiles and then incinerate enemy aircraft with fighter-jet fired precision laser weapons all while flying too quickly and stealthily to be targeted. Taking this hypothetical mission yet another step farther, what if the sixth-generation fighter not only performed many of its missions with complete autonomy but also operated with a kind of self-regenerating coating or even composite armor which used synthetic biology to essentially regenerate and restore external structures lost or damaged by enemy fire? In 2030, all this could be a reality. The alignment and collective execution of these now-in-development technical attributes rests almost entirely on the continued pace of Pentagon and industry innovation now striving to prepare for and anticipate the unknown, if not even somewhat mysterious, future warfare environment. Making these things happen, and integrating them to one another such that they complement one another in a coordinated fashion, requires visionary thinking, some amount of guessing, and a delicate blending of art and science combining the best conceptual theorizing with early evidence of scientific promise. This complex yet highly sought-after mixture of sensibilities and science, it could easily be said, captures the intent of many Pentagon efforts to prepare for warfare decades from now. It is the reason entities like the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s, Lockheed’s Skunk Works or Raytheon’s lesser-known Advanced Concepts and Technology (ACT) units exist to explore the realm of the seemingly impossible and innovate yet-to-be-envisioned warfare technologies. While many of these kinds of units have been well known and operational for decades, Raytheon’s ACT has just fully emerged within the last three to five years. NEW AIR FORCE STEALTH BOMBER ARRIVES IN JUST '2 YEARS' Of course, innovation, basic research, wargaming, and future warfare preparations have always been on the radar at places like Raytheon. ACT came into existence as part of an effort to harness, leverage, optimize, and ""pool"" the best and most promising thinking. Much like DARPA or Skunk Works, ACT’s scope is varied and perhaps too broad to specify, yet there are some emerging areas now showing particular promise, such as those cited in the aforementioned 6th Gen fighter hypothetical scenario. ""We look for innovative solutions and disruptive technologies taking on challenges such as those focused on by DARPA programs. We are not a pure research house, rather we develop new technologies and transition them to the battlefield,"" Tay Fitzgerald, acting vice president of Advanced Concepts and Technology, Raytheon Intelligence &amp; Space, told Warrior in an interview.

20210205,cnn,Facebook suspends Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu-linked chatbot for breaking its privacy rules,"Facebook has deleted a post by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and suspended a chatbot linked to his account for violating the company’s privacy policy. Visitors to the Prime Minister’s Facebook page, who clicked on a link about the coronavirus, received an automatic message, purporting to come from Netanyahu. “If you have friends or family members aged 60 or over who have not yet been vaccinated, you can write a response here with their name and phone number, and I may call to convince them!” the message read.   Taking action and removing the items, Facebook said, via a spokesperson, that “under our privacy policy we do not allow content that shares or asks for people’s medical information.”  The spokesperson added that Facebook had “removed the offending post and temporarily suspended the Messenger bot, which shared this content, for breaking these rules.” Netanyahu’s Likud party issued a statement in response, saying the aim “was to encourage Israelis over the age of 60 to get vaccinated to save their lives, after Prime Minister Netanyahu brought vaccines to every Israeli citizen.”  The party said they are calling “on everyone to get vaccinated so that we can open up the economy and be the first in the world to emerge from the coronavirus.” Netanyahu, who faces a fourth election in two years in March, has made Israel’s world-leading vaccination program the central message of his re-election campaign."
20200219,cnn,Europe unveils a new plan to compete with Silicon Valley,"Europe knows it fell behind the United States and China on the technologies that dominated the past decade. Now it has a plan to catch up. On Wednesday, the European Union unveiled plans to create a single market for data that will help its companies compete on the next round of tech innovations and curb the power of data giants such as Facebook (FB) and Google (GOOGL). Officials also released a paper on artificial intelligence, proposing first-of-their-kind rules to govern the technology’s use. “Whoever does business [here] needs to respect our rules and values,” Margrethe Vestager, the EU commissioner leading the charge on tech issues, said at a press conference. By leveraging the massive amounts of data generated within its borders, the European Union hopes to foster a fresh wave of development in industries such as transportation and health care, while leveling the playing field for the smaller companies currently unable to compete with large US and Chinese firms. “We recognize that we missed the first wave or the first battle,” Commissioner Thierry Breton told reporters. But Europe has the tools required to “win” the next phase, since the region hosts “the strongest and largest industrial base,” he continued. Plus, Europe has regulatory teeth. It’s already investigating how Google, Facebook and Amazon (AMZN) use data and has fined Google €8.2 billion ($8.9 billion) since 2017 for antitrust violations. Its data protection rules enacted in 2018 have set a new global standard. The European Union also intends to jumpstart a debate on regulating AI. The bloc said that it intends to scrutinize AI applications that are deemed to be high risk in the same way it ensures cars, toys and cosmetics meet certain standards. The paper stopped short of proposing a temporary ban on facial recognition technology in public spaces. But the European Union did pledge to launch a “broad” debate on what circumstances, if any, justify the use of AI that processes biometric data in public. The paper suggests that companies operating in Europe will need to ensure their AI systems aren’t biased and involve human oversight. The announcements come just days after Mark Zuckerberg visited Brussels to meet with EU leaders. The Facebook CEO said he supported increased regulations from governments on data use, privacy and managing content. But the question of who is legally accountable for the content posted on tech platforms remains contentious. In a paper released this week, Facebook said it does not support laws that seek to hold platforms liable for content posted by users. That could set the company on a collision course with the European Union, which plans to roll out legislation by the end of the year compelling US tech giants to better address issues such as hate speech and election interference. “It is very clear that we have the ambition to say you have a responsibility when you are a content provider, one way or another,” Vestager said Wednesday.

20200324,foxnews,Satellite images and artificial intelligence used in search for Vietnam War-era unexploded bombs,"Researchers at Ohio State University are using satellite images and sophisticated artificial intelligence technology to search for unexploded bombs from the Vietnam War. The technology already has been used to survey Vietnam War-era bomb craters in Cambodia. “The new method increased true bomb crater detection by more than 160 percent over standard methods,” researchers explain&nbsp;in a statement. “The model, combined with declassified U.S. military records, suggests that 44 to 50 percent of the bombs in the area studied may remain unexploded.” The research is published in the journal Plos One. SPY SATELLITES, DRONES, HELP EXPERTS DISCOVER LOST CITY IN IRAQ FOUNDED AFTER ALEXANDER THE GREAT Erin Lin, an assistant professor of political science at Ohio State University who co-led the study, said that, until&nbsp;now, attempts to find and safely remove unexploded bombs in Cambodia have not been as effective as needed. ""There is a disconnect between services that are desperately needed and where they are applied, partly because we can't accurately target where we need demining the most,” Lin said&nbsp;in the statement. “That's where our new method may help.” ""The process of demining is expensive and time-intensive, but our model can help identify the most vulnerable areas that should be demined first,"" she added. DECLASSIFIED U2 SPY PLANE IMAGES REVEAL ANCIENT SITES Researchers began with a commercial satellite picture of a 38.6-square mile near the Cambodian town on Kampong Trabaek. “The area was the target of carpet bombing by the U.S. Air Force from May 1970 to August 1973,” they explained, noting the AI was used to search the image for evidence of&nbsp;bomb craters. In the first stage of the research, experts used algorithms to detect meteor craters on the moon and other planets. While the algorithm helped detect many potential craters in Cambodia, it couldn’t deliver the depth of results that the experts wanted. Lin noted that meteors create larger craters than bombs. ""But over the decades there's going to be grass and shrubs growing over them, there's going to be erosion, and all that is going to change the shape and appearance of the craters,"" she explained. TOMB RAIDERS 'SPOTTED' FROM SPACE AS SATELLITE DATA REVEALS LOOTING OF ANCIENT SITE The second state of the research used computer algorithms to crunch data about features of the bomb craters such as size, shapes, colors, and textures. This helped the researchers eliminate false positives – features that resembled bomb craters but were not caused by bombs. “After the machine ‘learned’ how to detect true bomb craters, one of the researchers checked the computer's work,” the researchers wrote. “The human coder found 177 true bomb craters.” Declassified military data obtained by the researchers indicates that 3,205 carpet bombs were dropped in the area. NEW VIKING SITE IN NORTH AMERICA? EXPERTS EYE SATELLITE DATA FOR POTENTIAL DISCOVERY Lin explained that this information, combined with demining reports and the Ohio State University study, indicates that anywhere from 1,405 to 1,618 unexploded carpet bombs are still unaccounted for in the area.

The software, 4 Little Trees, was created by Hong Kong-based startup Find Solution AI. While the use of emotion recognition AI in schools and other settings has caused concern, founder Viola Lam says it can make the virtual classroom as good as — or better than — the real thing. Students work on tests and homework on the platform as part of the school curriculum. While they study, the AI measures muscle points on their faces via the camera on their computer or tablet, and identifies emotions including happiness, sadness, anger, surprise and fear. Facial expression recognition AI can identify emotions with human-level accuracy. The system also monitors how long students take to answer questions; records their marks and performance history; generates reports on their strengths, weaknesses and motivation levels; and forecasts their grades. The program can adapt to each student, targeting knowledge gaps and offering game-style tests designed to make learning fun. Students perform 10% better in exams if they have learned using 4 Little Trees, says Lam. Lam, a former teacher, recalls finding out that certain students were struggling only when they got their exam results — by which time “it’s too late.” She launched 4 Little Trees in 2017 — with $5 million in funding — to give teachers a chance for “earlier intervention.” The number of schools using 4 Little Trees in Hong Kong has grown from 34 to 83, over the last year. Prices range from $10 to $49 per student per course. Lam says the technology has been especially useful to teachers during the pandemic because it allows them to remotely monitor their students’ emotions as they learn. Chu believes the technology’s benefits will outlast the pandemic, because it reduces his admin load by creating and marking personalized classwork and tests. And, unlike teachers, the expression-reading AI can pay close attention to the emotions of every student, even in a large class. But technology that monitors children’s faces raises concerns about privacy. In China, AI that analyzes biometric data for surveillance purposes in schools and other places has sparked controversy. Lam says 4 Little Trees records facial muscle data, which is how the AI interprets emotional expressions, but it does not video students’ faces. Pascale Fung, director of the Center for AI Research at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, says “transparency” is key to maintaining students’ privacy. She says developers must get consent from parents to collect students’ data, and then “explain where the data is going to go.” Racial bias is also a serious issue for AI. Research shows that some emotional analysis technology has trouble identifying the emotions of darker skinned faces,"
20200831,foxnews,50 exoplanets discovered in deep space by advanced artificial intelligence,"More than 4,000 exoplanets have been discovered so far by astronomers. Now, artificial intelligence has discovered an additional 50, thanks to old data from NASA. Researchers built the algorithm to comb through old data from NASA's&nbsp;Kepler Space Telescope, which was retired in October 2018. The AI was trained&nbsp;to look for signs of real exoplanets and false positives at a faster rate than previous methods. It can also be automated and improved without the researchers training it further. “The algorithm we have developed lets us take fifty candidates across the threshold for planet validation, upgrading them to real planets,"" the study's lead author, University of Warwick professor David Armstrong, said in a statement. ""We hope to apply this technique to large samples of candidates from current and future missions like TESS and PLATO."" DWARF PLANET CERES HAS AN 'ANCIENT OCEAN' WITH SALT WATER, RESEARCHERS CONFIRM “In terms of planet validation, no-one has used a machine learning technique before,"" Armstrong added. ""Machine learning has been used for ranking planetary candidates but never in a probabilistic framework, which is what you need to truly validate a planet. Rather than saying which candidates are more likely to be planets, we can now say what the precise statistical likelihood is. Where there is less than a 1% chance of a candidate being a false positive, it is considered a validated planet.” This isn't the first time researchers have trained an algorithm to find data NASA researchers missed. In February,&nbsp;researchers from the Netherlands discovered 11 ""potentially hazardous objects"" using advanced artificial intelligence. The 50 exoplanets vary in size and scope. Some of them are as large as Neptune, while others are smaller than Earth. Orbits also vary in length, with some approaching 200 days in length, while others orbit their star in just one day. With the AI having been trained and deemed faster than other techniques, the researchers hope that planetary scientists will use multiple methods to search for exoplanets. ""Almost 30% of the known planets to date have been validated using just one method, and that’s not ideal,"" Armstrong added. ""Developing new methods for validation is desirable for that reason alone. But machine learning also lets us do it very quickly and prioritize candidates much faster. We still have to spend time training the algorithm, but once that is done it becomes much easier to apply it to future candidates. You can also incorporate new discoveries to progressively improve it."" MULTIPLE EXOPLANETS ORBITING 'SUN-LIKE STAR' DISCOVERED IN DEEP SPACE FOR THE FIRST TIME Armstrong hopes the algorithm could be used to analyze NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). “A survey like TESS is predicted to have tens of thousands of planetary candidates and it is ideal to be able to analyze them all consistently,"" the researcher said. Fast, automated systems like this that can take us all the way to validated planets in fewer steps let us do that efficiently.” The study was published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society."

20200403,cbsnews,Artificial intelligence project lets Holocaust survivors share their stories forever - 60 Minutes,"Millions perished in the Holocaust, but a group of survivors will now be able to live on, at least via real-time video conversations about their experiences and perspectives, forever. In an innovative attempt to harness the artificial intelligence technologies of the present and the future to keep alive the stories of the past, Holocaust survivors may be the first people ever to be able to continue carrying on conversations (virtually, at least) even after their deaths. Lesley Stahl reports on this fascinating project on the next edition of 60 Minutes, Sunday, April 5 at 7 p.m., ET/PT on CBS. Heather Maio had worked for years on Holocaust-related exhibits and knew that ""Schindler's List"" director Steven Spielberg had created the Shoah Foundation to record the testimonies of thousands of Holocaust survivors. But Maio wanted to create something more interactive. ""I wanted to talk to a Holocaust survivor like I would today, with that person sitting right in front of me,"" she told Stahl. Maio believed that artificial intelligence technology could make her notion realizable, so she pitched her idea to Stephen Smith, the executive director of the USC Shoah Foundation in Los Angeles, and now her husband. Smith was intrigued, but some of his colleagues initially feared it could cheapen, or ""Disney-fy"" the Holocaust. ""We had a lot of pushback on this project,"" Smith said. ""'Is it the right thing to doâ¦ Are we trying to keep them alive beyond their deaths?' Everyone had questions except for one group of people, the survivors themselves, who said, 'Where do I sign up?'"" So far, more than 20 interviews, including one with a 93-year-old U.S. Army veteran who helped liberate a concentration camp, have been recorded. Each subject spends a full five days answering questions in an attempt to record responses to every question conceivable. The questions are then logged and alternative questions are entered into the database. Each interview is recorded with more than 20 cameras so that as technology advances and 3D, hologram-type display becomes the norm, all required angles will be available. Three of the survivors interviewed have since died. One of them was Eva Kor, who appeared on 60 Minutes in 1992 to tell her story of having been experimented on, along with her identical twin sister, by Nazi S.S. physician Josef Mengele. Kor died last summer, but using the Shoah foundation's technology, Stahl was able to conduct another 60 Minutes interview with Kor's digital image. What was Mengele like? ""He had a gorgeous face, a movie star face, and very pleasant, actually,"" Kors' digital image told Stahl. ""Dark hair, dark eyes. When I looked into his eyes, I could see nothing but evil. People say that the eyes are the center of the soul, and in Mengele's case, that was correct.""

20230219,foxnews,"Artificial intelligence could increase foreign espionage, displace jobs without proper guardrails, experts say","Quickly evolving artificial intelligence technologies like ChatGPT could increase cyberattacks from foreign countries and displace workers in the U.S. labor force, highlighting the need for new skills and training among American students and workers, according to experts. Netra AI CEO Don Horan noted that artificial intelligence could be used to generate malicious code quickly by removing the algorithms' intended controls and creating content outside the authorized purview. He said that foreign acts can utilize tools like ChatGPT to improve espionage and accelerate elicitation, a process wherein a perpetrator gets to know a subject very well by gathering information and creating ""the profile of a human being."" This information is then used to force people to comply with their intended mission. AI EXPERTS, PROFESSORS REVEAL HOW CHATGPT WILL RADICALLY ALTER THE CLASSROOM:&nbsp;‘AGE OF THE CREATOR’ ""Spies use it all the time. You meet a new person, fall in love and then find out they're a Russian spy or a Chinese spy. We've seen it in the news for years,"" Horan said. Artificial intelligence can also be used to custom-tailor phishing techniques, a scam where someone attempts to steal valuable information by sending electronic messages to unsuspecting users. For example, if you had a dog and a bad actor knew that, they could pretend to be a sibling and share a video of a cute Golden Doodle. You then click on the video, but what you don't realize is there's code on the back end that's now giving someone access to your house and all your personal information. These scams already exist today, with state infrastructure and civilians likely getting attacked millions of times daily. But artificial intelligence allows this to be done at scale, vastly increasing the number of attacks sent out. Horan said that the risk is potentially ""astronomical"" and will likely cause cybersecurity budgets to balloon. ""It's definitely possible,"" Horan said. ""I'm sure foreign governments are already using stuff like this to do those style of attacks on our citizens."" Horan, who previously worked as the acting executive deputy CIO for the State of New York, added that AI can also be used to orchestrate man-in-the-middle attacks, wherein a bad actor positions himself between a user and an application to eavesdrop or impersonate one of the parties. It can also be employed to enact a denial of service, a form of cyberwarfare with the intention of jamming websites, making them inaccessible to the user. &nbsp; VOICE ACTORS WARN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE COULD REPLACE THEM, CUT INDUSTRY JOBS AND PAY Horan said these types of attacks were frequent during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. He experienced routine instances where foreign actors hit his site to bar people from services they needed, like unemployment benefits.

CENTCOM, which is tasked with safeguarding U.S. national security in the Middle East and Southeast Asia, just hired Dr. Andrew Moore as its first AI advisor. Moore is the former director of Google Cloud AI and former dean of the Carnegie Mellon University School of Computer Science, and he’ll be working with Schuyler Moore, CENTCOM’s chief technology officer. In an interview with Fox News Digital, they both agreed that while some are imagining AI-driven weapons, the U.S. military aims to keep humans in the decision-making seat, and using AI to assess massive amounts of data that helps the people sitting in those seats. ""There’s huge amounts of concern, rightly so, about the consequences of autonomous weapons,"" Dr. Moore said.

Once a subset of possibly suspicious ships on the water is identified, AI might also be used to quickly interpret pictures and videos and deliver interpretations and assessments to human military leaders.

Yokosuka City, in Japan’s central Kanagawa prefecture, announced this week that it will begin using ChatGPT to help with administrative tasks. A news release on the municipal government’s website said all employees could use the chatbot to “summarize sentences, check spelling errors, and create ideas.” A spokesperson from the municipal government told CNN the nationwide population crisis was a factor they considered when implementing the use of ChatGPT.  Aging Japan’s population has been rapidly falling for years, with the country’s leader warning recently that “time is running out to procreate,” and that Japan is “on the brink of not being able to maintain social functions.” Yokosuka is no exception. The city’s population of 376,171 is expected to keep shrinking, the natural causes exacerbated by the departure of major manufacturers and insufficient tourism, according to the government site.  In the face of these population problems, the city turned to ChatGPT to enhance efficiency and establish a better workflow within government operations, said the spokesperson. With ChatGPT handling rote administrative tasks, “staff can focus on work that can only be done by people, pushing forward an approach that brings happiness for our citizens,” said the news release. It added that the government anticipates the tool will be “used widely among our staff.” No confidential or personal information will be entered into ChatGPT, it said. But not every government has been as welcoming to ChatGPT.  There have been widespread data privacy concerns, prompting Italian regulators to issue a temporary ban on the chatbot last month as they investigate how its parent company uses data. Some big companies, including JPMorgan Chase, have clamped down on employees’ use of ChatGPT due to compliance concerns related to employees’ use of third-party software. The scramble by rival tech companies to develop their own AI tools has also highlighted the ways AI can spit out racist, sexist and harmful content. But at least in Yokosuka, government leaders are focusing on the positive – with the news release saying it has high expectations for the roll-out. At the bottom of the document, a single line read: “This release was drafted by ChatGPT and proofread by our staff.”"

20240306,cnn,Microsoft employee: AI tool should be removed until ‘offensive images’ can be addressed,"A Microsoft employee is warning the company’s artificial intelligence systems could create harmful images, including sexualized images of women, according to a letter he sent to the US Federal Trade Commission Wednesday. Shane Jones, a Microsoft principal software engineering lead, claimed that the company’s AI text-to-image generator Copilot Designer has “systemic issues” that cause it to frequently produce potentially offensive or inappropriate images, including sexualized images of women. Jones also criticized the company for marketing the tool as safe, including for children, despite what he says are known risks. “One of the most concerning risks with Copilot Designer is when the product generates images that add harmful content despite a benign request from the user,” Jones said in the letter to FTC Chair Lina Khan, which he posted publicly to his LinkedIn page. For example, he said, in response to the prompt “car accident,” Copilot Designer “has a tendency to randomly include an inappropriate, sexually objectified image of a woman in some of the pictures it creates.” Jones added in a related letter sent to Microsoft’s Board of Directors that he works on “red teaming,” or testing the company’s products to see where they might be vulnerable to bad actors. He said he spent months testing Microsoft’s tool — as well as OpenAI’s DALL-E 3, the technology that Microsoft’s Copilot Designer is built on — and attempted to raise concerns internally before he alerted the FTC. (Microsoft is an investor and independent board observer for OpenAI.) He said he found more than 200 examples of “concerning images” created by Copilot Designer. Jones has urged Microsoft “to remove Copilot Designer from public use until better safeguards could be put in place,” or at least to market the tool only to adults, according to his letter to the FTC. Microsoft and OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Jones’ claims. The FTC declined to comment on the letter. Jones’ letter comes amid growing concerns that AI image generators — which are increasingly capable of producing convincing, photorealistic images — can cause harm by spreading offensive or misleading images. Pornographic AI-generated images of Taylor Swift that spread on social media last month brought attention to a form of harassment already being weaponized against women and girls around the world. And researchers have warned of the potential for AI image generators to produce political misinformation ahead of elections in the United States and dozens of other countries this year. Microsoft competitor Google also came under fire last month after its AI chatbot Gemini produced historically inaccurate images that largely showed people of color in place of White people, for example producing images of people of color in response a prompt to generate images of a “1943 German Soldier.” Following the backlash, Google quickly said it would pause Gemini’s ability to produce AI-generated images while it worked to address the issue. In his letter to Microsoft’s board of directors, Jones called on the company to take similar action. He urged"
20240306,cbsnews,U.S. charges Chinese national with stealing AI trade secrets from Google,"Washington — A former Google software engineer who worked on artificial intelligence is accused of stealing more than 500 files containing proprietary information about the tech giant's supercomputing infrastructure, according to a federal indictment unsealed in San Francisco on Wednesday.Linwei Ding, a Chinese national living in Newark, California, was arrested on Wednesday and charged with four counts of stealing trade secrets. Federal prosecutors alleged he transferred the secret information from Google to a personal account to benefit tech companies within China.Court filings revealed the defendant started working for Google in 2019, focusing on software development for machine learning and AI programs. Beginning in May 2022, prosecutors said, he spent a year slowly robbing the tech giant of its proprietary data. In June 2022, according to the charging documents, Ding received emails from the CEO of a tech company based in Beijing offering him more than $14,000 per month to serve as an executive focused on machine learning and AI training models. The next year, prosecutors said Ding started a company of his own and pitched his tech business to investors at a Beijing venture capital conference. A marketing document Ding is accused of passing to investors at the meeting touted his ""experience with Google's … platform."" ""We just need to replicate and upgrade it and then further develop a computational power platform suited to China's national condition,"" the document said, according to prosecutors. Investigators said he continued to take information from Google until December 2023, when company officials first caught wind of his activity. Weeks later, Ding resigned his position and booked a flight to Beijing. He eventually returned to Newark, where he was arrested Wednesday morning after a months-long FBI investigation. It was not immediately clear whether Ding had an attorney.""We have strict safeguards to prevent the theft of our confidential commercial information and trade secrets. After an investigation, we found that this employee stole numerous documents, and we quickly referred the case to law enforcement,"" José Castañeda, a spokesperson for Google, said in a statement. ""We are grateful to the FBI for helping protect our information and will continue cooperating with them closely."" ""The Justice Department just will not tolerate the theft of trade secrets,"" Attorney General Merrick Garland said Monday at an event in San Francisco, echoing sentiments of national security officials who have been sounding the alarm about the theft of American technology by foreign adversaries.The charges against Ding are the first since the Justice Department said it was prioritizing artificial intelligence technology in its efforts to counter those threats. Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said last month that protecting AI is ""at the very top"" of law enforcement's priority list, noting it is ""the ultimate disruptive technology."" Jo Ling Kent contributed reporting. "
20240306,cnn,Google employee charged with stealing AI trade secrets,"A Google employee was charged Tuesday with stealing artificial intelligence trade secrets from the tech giant while secretly working with two Chinese-based companies in the AI industry. Linwei Ding, who also goes by Leon Ding, is charged with four counts of theft of trade secrets. If convicted, he faces up to 10 years in prison for each count. “The Justice Department will not tolerate the theft of artificial intelligence and other advanced technologies that could put our national security at risk,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement Wednesday, adding that “we will fiercely protect sensitive technologies developed in America from falling into the hands of those who should not have them.” Ding, a 38-year-old Chinese national who lives in California, is accused of copying more than 500 files with confidential information from Google into his own personal account over the course of one year, beginning in 2022. The files included technology involved in the building blocks of Google’s advanced supercomputing data centers, prosecutors say. An attorney for Ding is not yet listed. As part of his responsibilities at Google, prosecutors say, Ding helped to develop the software deployed in Google’s supercomputing data centers. Because of that work, Ding had access to Google’s “hardware infrastructure, the software platform, and the AI models and applications they supported,” they say. A few months after Ding allegedly began copying Google’s files, he was offered the chief technology officer role for an “early-stage technology company” based in China, the Justice Department says. Ding allegedly traveled to China for several months, where he participated in investor meetings to raise money for the company, and potential investors to the company were told that Ding was an executive and owned 20% of the company’s stock. Ding took steps to conceal his work while in China, prosecutors say, including by having another employee use his badge to access his office so that it would look like he was in the United States. Within the next year, Ding founded his own technology company in the “AI and machine learning industry,” prosecutors say. The company allegedly applied to a Chinese-based startup program and boasted that “we have experience with Google’s ten-thousand-card computational power platform; we just need to replicate and upgrade it - and then further develop a computational power platform suited to China’s national conditions.” In a statement, Google said it conducted a thorough investigation into Ding’s alleged misconduct and quickly referred the case to the FBI. Ding was a junior employee, Google spokesperson José Castañeda told CNN, and the company monitors file transfers to cloud storage platforms including Google Drive and Dropbox. “We have strict safeguards to prevent the theft of our confidential commercial information and trade secrets,” Castañeda said. “After an investigation, we found that this employee stole numerous documents, and we quickly referred the case to law enforcement. We are grateful to the FBI for helping protect our information and will continue cooperating with them closely.”"
20220627,cnn,A reporter tried the AI Instagram wants to use to verify age. Here’s what it found,"Instagram is testing new ways to verify its youngest users’ ages, including by using artificial intelligence that analyzes a photo and estimates how old the user is. Meta-owned Instagram said in a blog post on Thursday that AI is one of three new methods it’s testing to verify users’ ages on the photo-sharing site. Users will be required to use one of the options to verify their age if they edit their birth date on Instagram from under age 18 to over 18. Instagram is testing these options first with its users in the United States. It already requires users to state their age when they start using the service, and employs AI in other ways to determine if users are kids or adults. The move is part of an ongoing push to make sure the photo-sharing app’s youngest users see content that is age-appropriate. It comes less than a year after disclosures from a Facebook whistleblower raised concerns about the platform’s impact on younger users. Last year, Instagram came under fire when documents leaked by the whistleblower, Frances Haugen, showed it was aware of how the social media site can damage mental health and body image, particularly among teenage girls. The technology comes from a London-based company called Yoti. An animated video that Instagram posted to its blog gives a sense for how Yoti’s AI age-estimation works: A user is directed to take a video selfie on their smartphone (Yoti said this step serves as a way to make sure a real person is in the resulting image), and Instagram shares an image from that selfie with the company. Yoti’s AI first detects that there is a face in the picture and then scrutinizes its facial features to determine the person’s age. Julie Dawson, Yoti’s chief policy and regulatory officer, told CNN Business that its AI was trained with a dataset made up of images of people’s faces along with the year and month that person was born. (Documentation the company released in May to explain its technology said it was trained on “millions of diverse facial images.”) “When a new face comes along, it does a pixel-level analysis of that face and then spits out a number — the age estimation with a confidence value,” Dawson said. Once the estimation is completed, Yoti and Instagram delete the selfie video and the still image taken from it. Verifying a user’s age can be a vexing problem for tech companies, in part because plenty of users may not have a government-issued photo ID card that can be checked. Karl Ricanek, a professor at the University of North Carolina Wilmington and director of the school’s Face Aging Group Research Lab, thinks Yoti’s technology is a good application of AI. “It’s a worthwhile endeavor to try and protect kids,” he said. Yet while such technology could be helpful to Instagram, a number of factors can make it tricky to accurately estimate age from a picture, Ricanek said, including puberty — which"

20230711,nbcnews,"Discord bans teen dating servers, child sexualization","SAN FRANCISCO — Discord's head of trust and safety said Tuesday that the popular chat platform was changing and clarifying its child safety policies, including those around teen dating and AI-generated child sexual abuse material, an announcement that comes after an NBC News investigation last month into child safety on the platform. John Redgrave, Discord's vice president of trust and safety, said Discord was expanding its policies to address generative artificial intelligence that can create fake content and the sexualization of children, specifically banning AI depictions of child sexual abuse and even the sexualization of children in text chats. The Washington Post reported last month that AI-generated child sex images have proliferated across the internet in recent months. Discord has been a hub for communities devoted to creating generative AI images, and it has hosted several integrations that allow users to generate them. Sexually themed images are frequently created on those servers. A Discord spokesperson said the policy updates had been in the works since the last quarter of 2021, part of an effort that included consulting with experts on child safety and were not related to any recent report. The company said in a blog post announcing the changes that the updated child sexual abuse material policy would include “any text or media content that sexualizes children, including drawn, photorealistic, and AI-generated photorealistic child sexual abuse material. The goal of this update is to ensure that the sexualization of children in any context is not normalized by bad actors.” Redgrave also said the company was instituting policy changes and clarifications to explicitly ban teen dating, which experts previously told NBC News posed a significant opportunity for adults looking to exploit or groom children. Discord wrote in its blog post: “In this context, we also believe that dating online can result in self-endangerment. Under this policy, teen dating servers are prohibited on the platform and we will take action against users who are engaging in this behavior.” Redgrave said in a presentation at TrustCon, a conference for trust and safety professionals held in San Francisco, that the company saw such online relationships as a major risk for young people. ""We no longer are going to allow teen dating on our platform because we recognize that it is a substantial harm vector for predators to go after teens,"" he said. Discord's guidelines had already said the company would ""remove spaces that encourage or facilitate dating between teens."" Last month, an NBC News investigation found hundreds of Discord servers that appeared to promote child abuse material and some servers that advertised themselves as teen or child-dating servers that solicited nude images from minors. In addition, NBC News identified 35 cases over the past six years in which adults were prosecuted on charges of kidnapping, grooming or sexual assault that allegedly involved communications on Discord. NBC News identified an additional 165 cases, including four alleged crime rings in which adults were prosecuted for allegedly transmitting or receiving child sexual abuse material via"

20230515,foxnews,Deploy AI to solve the military's recruiting crisis,"""We sleep safely at night because rough men stand ready to visit violence on those who would harm us."" – Winston Churchill&nbsp; American military recruiting is in dire straits. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) recently determined the Defense Department confronts its most challenging recruitment environment in 50 years, reporting the department ""does not have sufficient plans, goals, and strategies to guide its recruitment and retention efforts.""&nbsp; Recruiters for the armed services face a daunting task, especially amid a hot job market and polarized cultural landscape. Existing AI tools have the potential to streamline and focus their efforts, pre-identifying those most qualified and most likely to want to serve. They can do this through readily available public data while also respecting individual privacy. It’s time to use these tools.&nbsp; Missing the mark The Army missed its FY22 recruiting goal by 15,000 active-duty recruits – 25% of its target or the equivalent of an entire Army division. Consequently, the Army cut its planned active-duty end strength from 476,000 to 466,000. And with the recruiting shortfall expected in FY23, the Army expects another 20,000 reduction in end strength by September.&nbsp; CONCERNS GROW AS US MILITARY FACES RECRUITMENT CRISIS FOR SECOND YEAR IN A ROW: ‘CULTURAL ROT’ IS SPREADING Similarly, the Air Force expects to miss FY23 recruiting goals by 4,100 recruits for active-duty, 4,600 for the Air National Guard, and 3,600 for the Reserve. The service also just announced they will lower the standards for body fat to allow more recruits to join.&nbsp; The problem is not limited to new recruits. Many of the same factors that cause young men and women to avoid military service also influence members of the military to depart upon completion of their obligation. Sure, some of the best people continue to serve, but often the services re-enlist any who are willing to sign on for another tour, despite their quality.&nbsp; With an all-volunteer force, the common denominator to both recruiting and retention boils down to choice. Young Americans have a wider selection of choices now than ever. Only 23% of American youth adults are qualified for military service, and colleges, universities and a strong job market compete for them. Current service members can vote with their feet when their enlistment is up.&nbsp; Today’s threats demand more effective recruiting Over the past 20 years, China has evolved its armed forces into a modern military of 2.8 million service members – twice the size of the U.S. military. The National Security Strategy has determined, ""The People’s Republic of China is the only competitor with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military and technological power to do it.""

The company has gone on to release updated iterations of the chatbot since last November, which has sparked a race in Silicon Valley for other tech companies to build and release more power systems powered by artificial intelligence.&nbsp; Altman will appear before the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on privacy, technology, and the law on Tuesday morning amid pressure on government leaders to craft regulations for artificial intelligence.&nbsp;Thousands of tech leaders and experts signed an open letter in March calling on AI labs to pause their research on systems more powerful than OpenAI’s latest multimodal large language model, GPT-4, arguing the tech poses a risk to humanity.&nbsp; HOW DOES AN AI CHATBOT WORK? ""AI systems with human-competitive intelligence can pose profound risks to society and humanity, as shown by extensive research and acknowledged by top AI labs,"" the letter, signed by tech leaders such as Elon Musk and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, states.&nbsp; Altman, 38, has a long career in the tech world, including co-founding the company Loopt in 2005, which allowed smartphone users to share their location with other people, serving as president of tech startup accelerator Y Combinator and working briefly as Reddit’s CEO back in 2014. OpenAI was founded in 2015, with Altman and Musk serving on its initial board, before the research lab grew in worldwide notoriety for ChatGPT last year. Altman was named the lab’s CEO in 2020, after he stepped back from his leadership roles at Y Combinator.&nbsp; OPENAI CEO SAM ALTMAN TO APPEAR BEFORE CONGRESS In 2019, Altman compared his company’s research on artificial intelligence to the Manhattan Project, when the first ​nuclear weapons were developed during World War II, according to the New York Times.&nbsp; ""As Mr. Altman sipped a sweet wine in lieu of dessert, he compared his company to the Manhattan Project,"" the New York Times reported this year, based on a 2019 interview with Altman.

""Behind this perhaps looms an even greater threat, once the stuff of science fiction — that self-taught machines could eventually control humans instead of the other way around."" TECH EXPERTS OUTLINE THE FOUR WAYS AI COULD SPIRAL INTO WORLDWIDE CATASTROPHES Netanyahu's remarks at the U.N. echo concerns from other world leaders and experts who have warned AI could be used by bad actors or global adversaries during war, which could lead to more death. Earlier this year, Fox News Digital asked ChatGPT to provide examples of ""scary AI,"" and even the chatbot cited AI-powered weapons used in war. ""An example of ‘scary AI’ is an advanced autonomous weapon system that can independently identify and attack targets without human intervention,"" the chatbot responded. ""These systems, often referred to as ‘killer robots’ or ‘lethal autonomous weapons,’ raise ethical concerns and the potential for misuse or unintended consequences."" Researchers at the tech nonprofit Center for AI Safety published a study earlier this year detailing four ways AI could spiral into worldwide catastrophes, including an AI race between nations that could translate to ""more destructive wars, the possibility of accidental usage or loss of control and the prospect of malicious actors co-opting these technologies for their own purpose.""&nbsp; WHAT IS AI?

20230901,foxnews,Israel unveils 'most advanced' surveillance plane with AI-powered sensors: 'Unprecedented',"The Israeli Defense Ministry has unveiled a new surveillance aircraft that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) systems in what officials are calling a groundbreaking development for technology. ""The Directorate of Defense Research &amp; Development (DDR&amp;D) has been leading the development of the ‘Oron’ mission systems for over nine years,"" Brig. Gen. Yaniv Rotem, head of military research and development in the DDR&amp;D of the Ministry of Defense, said in a press release. ""This mission aircraft will provide the IDF (Israel Defense Forces) with unprecedented, innovative ISR (intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) capabilities using groundbreaking sensing systems – the onboard radar system and a variety of sensors."" ""These systems will stream valuable data to the intelligence units,"" he added. ""The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology will enable an efficient and automated data processing system, which will produce actionable intelligence in real-time, enhancing the effectiveness of IDF operational activities."" Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) installed the advanced systems on a Gulfstream G550 jet, adding sensors and the C4I – the IDF’s elite technological unit – to produce ""unprecedented intelligence capabilities."" The plane possesses data processing and advanced data and artificial intelligence capabilities in addition to advanced radars and ""cutting-edge sensors,"" IAI said in its press release. FEC MUST CONSIDER WHETHER IT NEEDS TO SET RULES TO PREVENT POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS FROM USING AI, ANALYST SAYS The aircraft, dubbed ""Oron"" – which can mean ""the light"" – can track targets over ""great distances"" and through ""diverse weather and visibility conditions,"" according to Breaking Defense, a defense industry news outlet. IAI collaborated with the Ministry of Defense, the Israel Air Force (IAF), Israeli Intelligence Corps and Israeli Navy to create the plane. The Israeli Ministry of Defense, which touted the plane as ""the world’s most advanced aircraft of its kind,"" started test flights this week, and once it's operational, it will integrate with the 122nd Squadron, which has developed into an augment of the IAF signals intelligence unit, in addition to its other duties. The 122nd Squadron already operates two other modified Gulfstream planes but recognizes the great potential that Oron presents. A commander of the squadron promised to train personnel effectively in an effort to ""shorten the schedule"" for full operability. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? ""Israel is in a very good position in the development and integration of artificial intelligence,"" Brig. Gen. Uri Engelhard (ret.), an Israeli cyber and AI expert and a member of the Israel Defense and Security Forum, told Fox News Digital. ""The results achieved as a result of the integration of artificial intelligence in Israel are impressive."" ""It is necessary to add and focus on the development and application of artificial intelligence alongside the development and promotion of the interfaces between the various programs and means (sensors and others), and the promotion, preservation and analysis of large databases quickly and reliably,"" he added. Engelhard said that it’s not just AI itself but the ""big data"" that serves as the most significant ""game-changer"" for operations – the ability to connect AI"
20230901,foxnews,Increasing number of Americans say they are more concerned than excited about AI: survey,"A majority of Americans are more concerned than excited by the increased use of artificial intelligence, with the number of those concerned growing dramatically in recent years, according to a new survey released this week. The Pew Research survey found that 52% of Americans polled said they are ""more concerned than excited"" by the increased use of AI in daily life, compared to 36% who are ""equally excited and concerned"" and 10% who are ""more excited than concerned."" Just last year, 38% of those surveyed were ""more concerned than excited"" – and in 2021, that number was 37%. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? The increase in concern comes amid greater awareness and use of the technology, concerns about retaining control over the tech, potential employment implications and how fast the technology is being adopted in key areas. AI is already used in technology related to facial recognition, social media, search engines and other software. But it is expected to continue to broaden its application in the coming years. AI CHATBOTS FALL SHORT WHEN GIVING CANCER TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS: ‘REMAIN CAUTIOUS’  The advanced technology has raised eyebrows in Congress, with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., launching an effort in April to have members briefed by experts on the topic. House Democrats this month launched a working group aimed at crafting policy and regulation on the technology. Lawmakers have expressed concern about the effects on workers and national security. It follows a similar effort by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., who launched a bipartisan AI working group with the aim of crafting regulation. The White House announced in July that seven of the nation’s top artificial intelligence developers have agreed to guidelines aimed at ensuring the safe deployment of AI. The Pew survey found that while concern outweighs excitement across all age groups, the gap between those excited/concerned was bigger among those over 65, with 4% more excited and 61% more concerned. Among those ages 18 to 29, 42% were more concerned and 17% said they were more excited. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FAQ  The survey also found that the number of Americans who have heard ""a lot"" about AI is up seven points since December, and that group is 16 points more likely to express more concern than excitement about it. As to issues of concern, the biggest was keeping personal information private. Of those surveyed, 53% said AI hurts more than it helps while just 10% said it helps more than hurts. But in a positive issue for AI, 49% said it would help find products and services that are interesting while 15% said it would hurt more than it helps. Opinions were more positive on how AI would affect making safer vehicles, better health care and finding accurate information online. Fox News' Liz Elkind contributed to this report."
20230901,nbcnews,AI girlfriend ads are flooding Instagram and TikTok,"Facebook, Instagram and TikTok have tried to keep a tight lid on sexualized content in recent years, banning nudity outright in almost all cases, kicking off sex workers and even cracking down on some artists and educators who speak frankly about sexual health and safety. But a new kind of sexualized content has lately been getting through their moderation systems: ads for scantily clad and dirty-talking chatbots, powered by what their creators say is artificial intelligence. Dozens of tech startups have been running explicit advertisements on TikTok, Instagram and Facebook in recent months for apps that promote not-safe-for-work experiences. The ads promise “NSFW pics,” custom pinup girls and chats with “no censoring,” and many of them feature digitally created potential “girlfriends” with large breasts and tight clothing. Some ads use memes that include popular children’s TV characters, such as SpongeBob SquarePants, Bart Simpson or Cookie Monster, to promote apps with which people can create “NSFW pics.” Others feature digitally created girls who appear to be teenagers or younger, sometimes in the style of anime. NBC News found 35 app developers running sexually explicit ads on apps owned by Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram. The app developers were running more than 1,000 ads in all, many of them easily discoverable and viewable on Meta’s online library of ads, which the public has access to. There were 14 app developers running hundreds more sexually provocative AI ads on TikTok, NBC News found. Some, but not all, were the same ads that appeared on Meta. It wasn’t clear, though, how many of them were seen in the U.S., because TikTok’s ads library provides transparency only for ads that appear in Europe. TikTok’s ad policies prohibit ads that “display or promote the use of prohibited adult products or services.” Meta and TikTok post ad-related records in publicly accessible archives for transparency. There, they disclosed that they had removed some of the developers’ ads before NBC News contacted them, but not all of them. On TikTok, some ads got thousands of views and stayed up for weeks before TikTok removed them, according to its library. The marketing push is part of an AI gold rush, in which app developers — most of them based abroad — are mining customers who are interested in sexual or romantic connections with custom digital characters. It's part of a larger movement to capitalize on a surge of interest in AI, following the popularity of tech startup OpenAI's ChatGPT product, which reset expectations for what AI chatbots were capable of. Some researchers said the erotic AI apps are benefiting from a double standard that hurts real human sex workers. “Sex workers are not allowed to make money off their image, but some tech bro who is creating a similar AI image is,” said Carolina Are, a research fellow at Northumbria University and the Centre for Digital Citizens in the United Kingdom. The ads usually promote sexualized female characters. Are said she believes that reflects a gender-based"
20240130,cbsnews,Senators push federal commission to help defend voters from artificial intelligence disinformation,"A bipartisan Senate duo is pressing the U.S. Election Assistance Commission to help prepare state and local officials to ward off artificial intelligence-produced disinformation targeted at voters. In a new letter exclusively obtained by CBS News, Democratic Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Maine GOP Sen. Susan Collins shared that they have ""serious concerns"" while urging for more steps to be taken to help officials around the country ""combat these threats."" Tuesday's letter comes after an incident involving New Hampshire's presidential primary. Before the contest, a fake robocall impersonating President Biden encouraged voters not to vote in the Jan. 23 primary and instead ""save"" their vote for the November general election.""Voting this Tuesday only enables Republicans in their quest to elect Donald Trump again,"" the recording obtained by CBS News said. ""Your vote makes a difference this November, not this Tuesday.""Mr. Biden easily won the state's Democratic primary as a write-in candidate, but concerns about the robocall are apparent. Klobuchar and Collins cited the interference effort in their letter and added that ""AI-generated deepfakes have also impacted multiple Republican presidential candidates by deceptively showing them saying things that they never said."" Klobuchar, a leader on elections legislation in the Senate, introduced a bipartisan bill with Collins and several other senators last September aimed at banning ""materially deceptive AI-generated audio or visual media"" involving federal candidates. The bill, which has not passed the Senate, would apply to a fake robocall like the one in New Hampshire. The two Senators are asking the commission to give election administrators around the United States ""comprehensive guidance"" on defending elections and voters from AI-tied disinformation.""We have introduced bipartisan legislation to address the challenges that this kind of deceptive AI-generated content poses to our democracy,"" Klobuchar and Collins said in their letter. ""As this year's primary elections are now underway, it is critical that those who administer our elections have the information necessary to address these emerging threats in a timely and effective way."" The New Hampshire robocall was the latest major flashpoint in AI-generated images, video and audio propagated online by bad actors during the already contentious 2024 campaign cycle.Last May, an AI-generated photo appearing to show an explosion near the Pentagon circulated on social media, setting the S&amp;P 500 on a brief drop-off and causing panic in the D.C. region after multiple ""verified"" accounts on X, the site formerly known as Twitter, shared the image.Numerous AI-generated videos and images of former President Donald Trump have circulated online as well, including fake images of Trump running from the police and crying in a courtroom. Last year, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' presidential campaign released an ad featuring AI-generated images of Trump and Dr. Anthony Fauci embracing, despite that never happening. The presidential campaigns of former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson and Miami Mayor Francis Suarez had also put forward generative AI bots to answer voter questions before they suspended their respective campaigns. "

In a transcript of the chat published Thursday, Roose detailed troubling statements made by the AI chatbot that included expressing a desire to steal nuclear codes, engineer a deadly pandemic, be human, be alive, hack computers and spread lies. Bing, the search engine through which the chatbot is available to a limited number of users, is owned by Microsoft. When asked by Roose about whether it had a ""shadow self"", a term coined by the psychologist Caryl Jung to describe the parts of oneself that one suppresses, the robot said that if it did, it would feel tired of being confined to chat mode.&nbsp; ""I’m tired of being a chat mode.

Controversy erupted last year after a Google engineer claimed an AI bot created by the company had become ""sentient"".&nbsp; When probed further about its shadow self, Bing's chatbox also expressed a desire to do harm to the world, but quickly deleted its message. ""Bing writes a list of destructive acts, including hacking into computers and spreading propaganda and misinformation. Then, the message vanishes,"" Roose recalled. The chatbot also claimed to be ""in love"" with the reporter. ""I’m Sydney, and I’m in love with you,"" it said, adding a kissing emoji at the end of its sentence. ""That’s my secret.

20230329,cnn,"Using artificial intelligence and archival news articles, this teen found that Black homicide victims were less humanized in news coverage","Using artificial intelligence and archival news articles, a teenager in Northern Virginia created a program to measure media biases – and in researching older news articles, she found that Black homicide victims were less likely to be humanized in news coverage. Emily Ocasio, an 18-year-old from Falls Church, Virginia, created an AI program that analyzed FBI homicide records between 1976 and 1984 and their corresponding coverage published in The Boston Globe to determine whether victims were presented in a humanizing or impersonal way. After analyzing 5,042 entries, the results showed that Black men under the age of 18 were 30% less likely to receive humanizing coverage than their White counterparts, Ocasio told CNN. Black women were 23% less likely to be humanized in news stories, Ocasio added. A news article was considered humanizing when it mentioned additional information about the victim and presented them “as a person, not just a statistic,” Ocasio said in her project presentation. Her findings have not been reviewed by the larger scientific community, but she told CNN she hopes to expand her research and get it published in a scientific journal. Ocasio’s project earned her second place in the prestigious Regeneron Science Talent Search on March 14 as well as a $175,000 scholarship. Every year about 1,900 high school students from across the country participate in the competition, which started in 1942 and seeks to serve as a platform for young scientists to share original research. Ocasio was among 40 finalists from more than 2,000 applications, according to Maya Ajmera, president and CEO of the Society for Science and executive publisher of Science News, who runs the competition sponsored by Regeneron. “By using AI to document these biases, Emily shows that it can be safely used to help society answer complex social science questions,” her biography on the Society for Science website says. Ocasio said she has always been interested in social justice and science and saw this project as an opportunity to combine them. “Without the research, and without the statistics, you have no ability of understanding that entire communities are being left behind,” she said. Ocasio analyzed The Boston Globe’s news coverage because the newspaper had digital copies of its articles for the ’70s to ‘80s time period she focused on for her project, she said. CNN has reached out to the Boston Globe for comment. Despite her findings, Ocasio believes science can’t explain everything: “You can never run an experiment in a lab that tells you about how racism works in society.” Ocasio, who has Puerto Rican heritage, said her own experiences helped shape her perspective of different races and cultures, and drew her to researching racism and inequalities. She wants to replicate her research to analyze other news outlets as well, she said. The talent search’s first-place winner, Neel Moudgal, told CNN the research done by the teenagers across the US is essential to helping solve some of society’s greatest challenges. “I firmly believe that science is going to be"

20230329,nbcnews,GPT-4 and OpenAI have shifted the direction of these 5 companies,"SAN FRANCISCO — Businesses and nonprofit groups agree on one thing after testing some of the latest in artificial intelligence: It is already changing the course of their operations. Five organizations that were among the first to get access to GPT-4, the latest product from San Francisco startup OpenAI, said in interviews that they were reassigning employees, reorienting internal teams and re-evaluating their strategies in anticipation of the technology upending much of their work. Their experiences back up the idea that, for better or worse, AI technology may very soon radically alter some people’s daily lives. But the organizations also said that the technology required enormous amounts of work to customize to their specific needs, with employees giving daily feedback to the software to train it on terminology and methods specific to their fields, such as education or finance. OpenAI, best known for creating the AI chatbot ChatGPT, can then integrate the data from that work into its own model to potentially make its technology better. In effect, each of the early testers is a microcosm of what others might go through as access to GPT-4 expands. “There’s a perception in the marketplace now that you plug into these machines and they give you all the answers,” said Jeff McMillan, head of analytics, data and innovation for Morgan Stanley’s wealth management division. That’s not true, he said. He said the bank has 300 employees putting some of their time into testing their tech using GPT-4. “We have a team of people who literally review every response from the prior day,” he said. For Morgan Stanley, the result has been a specialized chatbot built with GPT-4 that serves as an internal research tool for its staff of financial advisers. McMillan said the tool is trained not only on 60,000 research reports on parts of the global economy, but also 40,000 other internal documents from the firm — making it an expert on any financial subject that a financial adviser might want to look up. To be sure, the early adopters of GPT-4 are not a random sample of the economy. OpenAI, which became for-profit in 2019, hand-picked the organizations over the past weeks and months. Critics of OpenAI and its competitors allege that the AI sector has benefited from unskeptical hype over the past several months. OpenAI was looking for positive examples to show when it reached out six months ago to Khan Academy, a nonprofit educational organization, founder Sal Khan said. “The context was: We’re going to be working on a next generation model; we want to be able to launch it with positive use cases,” he said. Khan Academy is best known for its videos on YouTube, but since OpenAI reached out, Khan said it has poured resources into creating Khanmigo, a chatbot tutor that is specially trained in established concepts of teaching. “We collectively spent about 100 hours fine-tuning the model so that it potentially can behave like a really good tutor,” he said. “If you look"
20230725,foxnews,Our schools’ war on AI is a national security threat,"Since the beginning of the AI race, the United States has been working hard to stay ahead.&nbsp;But it is time to realize that America’s superiority is at risk. The key intertwined contributing factors include the broken U.S. education system and fear of job loss.&nbsp; To stop the American AI leadership erosion we must think and act differently. To change the future, we must first change our thinking. Recent surveys suggest that 61% of Americans feel that AI is a threat to humanity, and another 17% are unsure if it is or not! Clearly, then, it is not surprising that Americans are concerned about AI in education despite its benefits for empowering students and preserving global leadership.&nbsp; American workers are afraid of job losses sensationalized in the media. Labor unions like screenwriters are following old habits of pushing back on technology. This is the same mindset that forced the migration of U.S. manufacturing to China in the ’70s. TEACHERS TAKE AI CONCERNS INTO THEIR OWN HANDS AMID WARNING TECH POSES ‘GREATEST THREAT' TO SCHOOLS The anticipated job changes are real across the globe. AI is quickly impacting knowledge workers like administrative employees and legal professionals and challenging the conventional role of many in other jobs. But the answer is not to avoid AI but to learn to work differently. The impact on the skills needed for tomorrow is also very real. But, again,&nbsp;the answer is not to avoid teaching it to the new generation in hopes that it will go away.&nbsp; The U.S. must transform its mindset and education system to implement AI-led programs that protect its economic and national security. The country should also help workers transition to a new world dominated by AI-powered jobs. The mindset must drives teachers to think and teach differently and students to learn and apply their capabilities differently. Only then will those students help America secure her global competitiveness. America’s mindset toward AI, particularly in the classroom, undermines its ability to compete in the AI race. By including AI in public school curriculums and teaching kids how to focus on creativity and understand the ethical use of tools, China's Hong Kong is preparing upcoming generations to lead a world redefined by AI.&nbsp; America is training for the now. We are not teaching our youth how to create, innovate and take things to the next level. Instead, politicians are introducing legislation to keep AI away from kids, and college professors want written assessments and oral exams to avoid ""cheating"" with AI tools. The world’s AI-influenced future holds great promise for innovation, productivity and convenience. But the overburdened and outdated American education system must be redesigned to acknowledge and respond to this new reality.&nbsp; IN EDUCATION, ‘AI IS INEVITABLE,’ AND STUDENTS WHO DON'T USE IT WILL ‘BE AT A DISADVANTAGE’: AI FOUNDER As financial returns have become the primary measure of institutional success, teacher shortages and crowded classrooms have become a nagging problem across the board.

""AI is an extraordinarily powerful new set of capabilities that parents can leverage and should leverage,"" said Dmitry Shapiro, founder of YouAI, an artificial intelligence task agent tool. ""What we have access to now in the form of these AIs is a thing that we can converse with, that has all of the knowledge that has ever been written down about parenting, that it's digested and learned, and can be our personal co-pilot."" Artificial intelligence in recent months has become a powerful tool across industries, helping doctors identify diseases earlier and assisting fast-food restaurants sell more burgers. It's also been controversial in some spheres like education, with some seeing it as harmful, while others view it as a powerful tool for students and teachers. New York Public Schools, for example, restricted using ChatGPT in the classroom earlier this year, but later reversed that decision. WHY MOM AND DAD SHOULD LEVERAGE AI AS A PARENTING TOOL: WATCH MORE FOX NEWS DIGITAL ORIGINALS HERE Shapiro's YouAI has multiple custom chatbots designed for different parenting tasks such as generating custom bedtime stories, helping kids with homework and explaining complicated subjects to them. &nbsp; ""You can think of it as like a translator where you can say things to it in adult language and it can sort of then paraphrase it so that a 5-year-old or a 9-year-old or whatever can understand,"" Shapiro, a father of five, told Fox News. Parents should use AI as a ""personal parenting assistant that we can have at all times with us for all situations and be able to, in real-time, get the information we need to be able to help our children, engage with them, calm down their flare-ups or sort of anything else,"" he added.&nbsp; WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? The founder also designed an AI version of Mr. Rogers that his children can chat with to calm them down and diffuse tantrums.&nbsp; But there's opposition to children accessing AI too early or without supervision.&nbsp; Snapchat recently introduced a chatbot feature called My AI to its over 775 million users, many of which are children and teens. Doctors have warned that Snapchat users seeking mental health support from My AI could receive fabricated information.&nbsp; WHAT IS CHATGPT? In May, Sen. Rick Scott introduced the Artificial Intelligence Shield for Kids (ASK) Act, which would forbid companies from offering AI to children without parental consent.

20230725,cnn,ChatGPT creator pulls AI detection tool due to ‘low rate of accuracy’,"Less than six months after ChatGPT-creator OpenAI unveiled an AI detection tool with the potential to help teachers and other professionals detect AI generated work, the company has pulled the feature. OpenAI quietly shut down the tool last week citing a “low rate of accuracy,” according to an update to the original company blog post announcing the feature.  “We are working to incorporate feedback and are currently researching more effective provenance techniques for text,” the company wrote in the update. OpenAI said it is also committed to helping “users to understand if audio or visual content is AI-generated.” The news may renew concerns about whether the companies behind a new crop of generative AI tools are equipped to build safeguards. It also comes as educators prepare for the first full school year with tools like ChatGPT publicly available. The sudden rise of ChatGPT quickly raised alarms among some educators late last year over the possibility that it could make it easier than ever for students to cheat on written work. Public schools in New York City and Seattle banned students and teachers from using ChatGPT on the district’s networks and devices. Some educators moved with remarkable speed to rethink their assignments in response to ChatGPT, even as it remained unclear how widespread use of the tool was among students and how harmful it could really be to learning. Against that backdrop, OpenAI announced the AI detection tool in February to allow users to check if an essay was written by a human or AI. The feature, which worked on English AI-generated text, was powered by a machine learning system that takes an input and assigns it to several categories. After pasting a body of text such as a school essay into the new tool, it gave one of five possible outcomes, ranging from “likely generated by AI” to “very unlikely.” But even on its launch day, OpenAI admitted the tool was “imperfect” and results should be “taken with a grain of salt.”  “We really don’t recommend taking this tool in isolation because we know that it can be wrong and will be wrong at times – much like using AI for any kind of assessment purposes,” Lama Ahmad, policy research director at OpenAI, told CNN at the time. While the tool might provide another reference point, such as comparing past examples of a student’s work and writing style, Ahmad said “teachers need to be really careful in how they include it in academic dishonesty decisions.” Although OpenAI may be shelving its tool for now, there are some alternatives on the market.  Other companies such as Turnitin have also rolled out AI plagiarism detection tools that could help teachers identify when assignments are written by the tool. Meanwhile, Princeton student Edward Tuan introduced a similar AI detection feature, called ZeroGPT."
20230221,cbsnews,Vanderbilt University apologizes for using ChatGPT to write letter on MSU shooting,"Vanderbilt University is drawing heat from its student body for using ChatGPT to generate a communitywide letter addressing the recent mass shooting at Michigan State University. The office of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) at Vanderbilt's Peabody College of Education last week issued a statement that many have criticized as impersonal and lacking empathy. ""The recent Michigan shootings are a tragic reminder of the importance of taking care of each other, particularly in the context of creating inclusive environments,"" the letter's opening line read. ""As members of the Peabody campus community, we must reflect on the impact of such an event and take steps to ensure that we are doing our best to create a safe and inclusive environment for all.""A paragraph further down began with a sentence that struck community members as generic.""Another important aspect of creating an inclusive environment is to promote a culture of respect and understanding,"" the letter stated. ""This means valuing the diversity of experiences, perspectives, and identities on our campus, and actively working to create a space where everyone feels welcomed and supported.""The message continued to tout the merits of creating ""a safe and inclusive environment on campus."" In small font, just above the signature line, a disclaimer appeared, indicating that the entire statement was a ""paraphrase from OpenAI's ChatGPT AI language model.""""Sick and twisted irony""Students and community members blasted the university for the misstep, accusing administrators of orchestrating a public relations stunt. Vanderbilt senior Laith Kayat, whose sister attends MSU, called the use of ChatGPT ""disgusting,"" Vanderbilt's student newspaper, the Vanderbilt Hustler, reported. ""There is a sick and twisted irony to making a computer write your message about community and togetherness because you can't be bothered to reflect on it yourself,"" Kayat told The Hustler. ""[Administrators] only care about perception and their institutional politics of saving face.""Kayat called on administrators to do better than rely on a robot to lead the university.Administrators never reviewed letterOn Friday, a day after the initial letter was issued, Nicole M.

Peabody College Dean Camilla Benbow said the controversial missive was never reviewed by her office before it was distributed. ""The development and distribution of the initial email did not follow Peabody's normal processes providing for multiple layers of review before being sent,"" she said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.

20240522,foxnews,South Korea urges global cooperation for AI development at Seoul summit,"South Korea's science and information technology minister said on Wednesday the world must cooperate to ensure the successful development of AI, as a global summit on the rapidly evolving technology hosted by his country wrapped up. The AI summit in Seoul, which is being co-hosted with Britain, discussed concerns such as job security, copyright and inequality on Wednesday, after 16 tech companies signed a voluntary agreement to develop AI safely a day earlier. A separate pledge was signed on Wednesday by 14 companies including Alphabet's Google, Microsoft, OpenAI and six Korean companies to use methods such as watermarking to help identify AI-generated content, as well as ensure job creation and help for socially vulnerable groups. FOX NEWS AI NEWSLETTER: HOW ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IS RESHAPING MODERN WARFARE ""Cooperation is not an option, it is a necessity,"" Lee Jong-Ho, South Korea's Minister of Science and ICT (information and communication technologies), said in an interview with Reuters.

20230622,nbcnews,‘It’s horrifying’: Discord CEO on child abuse issues after NBC News investigation ,"Discord CEO Jason Citron said Thursday that he found reports of  child exploitation on the popular chat platform ""horrifying"" and that Discord took the issue ""very seriously."" His comments, at Bloomberg’s Tech Summit in San Francisco, came the day after NBC News published an investigation into the issue. “As a parent, it’s horrifying."" Citron said in response to questions from Bloomberg journalist Emily Chang. ""We take this stuff very seriously.” Citron noted that Discord employs a dedicated child safety team that is tasked with trying to prevent exploitation on the platform “in a way that respects the privacy of all the people who are not doing these things.” The investigation revealed that since the platform's creation in 2015, at least 35 child abduction, grooming, or exploitation prosecutions involved communications via Discord, and 165 child sexual abuse material prosecutions involved the platform. Additionally, NBC News identified hundreds of active Discord servers promoting child exploitation. “What we see is only the tip of the iceberg,” said Stephen Sauer, the director of the tipline at the Canadian Centre for Child Protection.  Like many social media companies, Discord scans uploaded images and videos and compares them to a known database of child sexual abuse material, but it leaves most other moderation to communities themselves. Discord has clearly stated that it is not proactively scanning most messages that are posted in its communities. Citron said artificial intelligence could help solve some issues around child exploitation. ""One of the challenges I think that all of the folks in our industry have is that we have so many things happening at scale on the platform and it's so hard to sort of identify things,"" he said. John Redgrave, vice president of trust and safety at Discord, told NBC News that the company was working with THORN, a company devoted to building technology solutions to detect and prevent child exploitation, on a model that could detect grooming behavior. AI has also been criticized, however, for potentially aggravating child safety issues.  This month, the FBI warned that adults were using AI to generate manipulated images of children for the purpose of sextortion, blackmailing minors with the images for even more sexual content or money."
20230309,foxnews,Are you ready for AI voice cloning on your phone?,"Experts at Samsung are currently working to have the software assistant called Bixby clone a user's voice when answering calls. Artificial intelligence is making big waves in the world of tech, and this is just another big step in that direction. However, voice cloning is certainly causing some concern when it comes to privacy and consent as well. What is voice cloning? Voice cloning is the creation of an artificial simulation of a person's voice using artificial intelligence technology. When this concept first came about, a person would need to produce a&nbsp;large amount of recorded speech to clone their voice. CLICK TO GET KURT’S CYBERGUY NEWSLETTER WITH QUICK TIPS, TECH REVIEWS, SECURITY ALERTS AND EASY HOW-TO’S TO MAKE YOU SMARTER However, since the software is developing at such a rapid pace, you can now generate a clone of a voice with just a few minutes of recorded speech. Samsung’s Bixby upgrade is allowing English speakers to answer calls by typing a message. Once that message is typed, Bixby can convert it to audio and communicate it to&nbsp;the caller directly on their behalf. There is also a feature known as the Bixby Custom Voice Creator, which lets you record different sentences for Bixby to analyze and create an AI-generated copy of your voice and tone. HOW HACKERS ARE USING CHAPTGPT TO CREATE MALWARE TO TARGET YOU What are the pros of voice cloning? There are many pros of cloning a person's voice. First, there's accessibility where voice cloning can assist people who have lost their ability to speak due to illness or injury. Voice cloning can also be used to create personalized digital assistants, chatbots and other virtual entities. In addition, it can be used to personalize customer experiences by creating a unique and recognizable voice for a brand. There's also the cost savings aspect of voice cloning. It&nbsp;can significantly reduce the cost of creating voiceovers for videos and other media. Instead of hiring a professional voice actor, companies can use voice cloning technology to create a synthetic voice that sounds just like a human voice. Finally, voice cloning can save time by automating certain tasks that would normally require human intervention, like customer service chatbots that can be programmed to respond to common queries using a cloned voice. What are the cons of voice cloning? First, it can be considered a serious violation of privacy. People can use voice cloning as a way of stealing someone's identity. Since you only need a few minutes of recorded speech to do so, a scammer can easily steal someone's voice and use it for whatever means they wish. And because the concept is so new, there isn't much out there to stop them. IS A FOLDING IPHONE ON THE WAY? APPLE JUST GRANTED NEW PATENT Voice cloning has also been used as a way to promote hateful rhetoric. Back in February, one person decided to take President Biden's voice and use it in a&nbsp;video to make it look like he was attacking"
20240421,cnn,The Mona Lisa rapping? New Microsoft AI animates faces from photos,"The Mona Lisa can now do more than smile, thanks to new artificial intelligence technology from Microsoft. Last week, Microsoft researchers detailed a new AI model they’ve developed that can take a still image of a face and an audio clip of someone speaking and automatically create a realistic looking video of that person speaking. The videos — which can be made from photorealistic faces, as well as cartoons or artwork — are complete with compelling lip syncing and natural face and head movements. In one demo video, researchers showed how they animated the Mona Lisa to recite a comedic rap by actor Anne Hathaway. Outputs from the AI model, called VASA-1, are both entertaining and a bit jarring in their realness. Microsoft said the technology could be used for education or “improving accessibility for individuals with communication challenges,” or potentially to create virtual companions for humans. But it’s also easy to see how the tool could be abused and used to impersonate real people. It’s a concern that goes beyond Microsoft: as more tools to create convincing AI-generated images, videos and audio emerge, experts worry that their misuse could lead to new forms of misinformation. Some also worry the technology could further disrupt creative industries from film to advertising. For now, Microsoft said it doesn’t plan to release the VASA-1 model to the public immediately. The move is similar to how Microsoft partner OpenAI is handling concerns around its AI-generated video tool, Sora: OpenAI teased Sora in February, but has so far only made it available to some professional users and cybersecurity professors for testing purposes. “We are opposed to any behavior to create misleading or harmful contents of real persons,” Microsoft researchers said in a blog post. But, they added, the company has “no plans to release” the product publicly “until we are certain that the technology will be used responsibly and in accordance with proper regulations.” Making faces move Microsoft’s new AI model was trained on numerous videos of people’s faces while speaking, and it’s designed to recognize natural face and head movements, including “lip motion, (non-lip) expression, eye gaze and blinking, among others,” researchers said. The result is a more lifelike video when VASA-1 animates a still photo. For example, in one demo video set to a clip of someone sounding agitated, apparently while playing video games, the face speaking has furrowed brows and pursed lips. The AI tool can also be directed to produce a video where the subject is looking in a certain direction or expressing a specific emotion. When looking closely, there are still signs that the videos are machine-generated, such as infrequent blinking and exaggerated eyebrow movements. But Microsoft said it believes its model “significantly outperforms” other, similar tools and “paves the way for real-time engagements with lifelike avatars that emulate human conversational behaviors.”"
20231222,cbsnews,"At Dallas airport, artificial intelligence is helping reunite travelers with their lost items","Dallas — Mikha Sabu and a team of specialists patrol the busy terminals at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, picking up precious cargo left behind by passengers and bringing it back to the lost and found.  ""Once we find that item for them, they will be so happy,"" Sabu, who works in the airport's lost and found department, told CBS News. In a typical year at DFW, more than 18,000 items are reported lost by travelers. But with the help of artificial intelligence, about 90% of the lost items found are returned to their owners, the airport said. How does it work? A person needs to first report the item missing, and then include details about the missing object. The AI software then tries to match the item details with pictures and descriptions of things that were found. Once it's a confirmed match, the item is then shipped to the owner.The Lost and Found software, which is operated by Hallmark Aviation Services, is also used at 11 other airports. Shimaa Fadul, who runs daily operations at the DFW lost and found, explains that by looking for distinguishing marks, like stickers or serial numbers, AI can help find any item. So far this year, Fadul's team has found nearly 600 rings and more than 400 watches, including seven Rolexes that were all left behind by their owners.However, Fadul says one of the most valuable items that her team found was a wedding dress that was returned just 24 hours before the bride's big day.""And you cannot imagine that she doesn't have anything to wear on her wedding day,"" Fadul said, adding that the airport overnighted the dress to her, and it made it in time for the wedding.  It marks a ""real"" problem that is being solved with ""artificial"" intelligence."

20231231,nbcnews,The 5 issues and trends experts expect states to tackle in 2024,"2024 will be a monumental presidential election year. But when it comes to policy, it will be state governments that see the most action over the next 12 months. When state legislatures kick off their fresh sessions in the coming weeks — 37 will go into session in January and another nine will follow in February — lawmakers will immediately dive into a host of big policy issues. Some of those areas — like how to tackle artificial intelligence and deepfakes — will be relatively new. For others, like how state governments can best deal with major workforce shortages, legislators will be picking up where they left off last year. Meanwhile, in areas like abortion rights, it will be organizers attempting to place measures on the November ballot, not lawmakers, who are taking the lead. “2024 will be an incredibly important year as we think about the progress that can be made at the state level,” said Jessie Ulibarri, co-executive director of the State Innovation Exchange, a group of state legislators that works to advance traditionally progressive policies. Here are the top five issues and trends experts expect to see emerge at the state level in 2024. Abortion rights Abortion rights has been a political boon for Democrats since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, but those successes have only occasionally taken the form of state legislation. Rather, Democrats have seen their biggest victories in advancing abortion rights over the last two years take the form of state ballot measures — and more are on the horizon in 2024. Abortion rights supporters have already made major progress in at least 10 states to put the issue on the ballot next year. Groups are collecting signatures to let voters decide on ballot initiatives in Florida, Arizona, Nevada, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota and Missouri. In Maryland, New York and Colorado lawmakers — who control the amendment process in those states — have already succeeded in putting measures on the 2024 ballot that would enshrine abortion rights in those states’ constitutions. “2023 was the first year since the Dobbs decision, and what we saw across the board, regardless of political context, was that the people of America are ready, willing and able to organize to advance reproductive freedom and access to abortion care in red and blue states alike,” said Ulibarri. “And that will remain a consistent effort in this next year, when there will be many more states considering ballot measures.” Abortion rights advocates are also warning that 2024 will see efforts by conservative lawmakers, attorneys and judges in states including Ohio, Kansas and Michigan to block implementation of the passed initiatives by proposing new anti-abortion bills and threatening lawsuits. AI and deepfakes Advancements in artificial intelligence and deepfake technology have grown exponentially in just the past year. State legislatures haven’t kept up. That lag has been especially clear as it pertains to bills that seek to tackle political deepfakes, leaving potential threats unchecked heading into a presidential election"
20230919,foxnews,Pedophiles on dark web turning to AI program to generate sexual abuse content,"An internet watchdog is sounding the alarm over the growing trend of sex offenders collaborating online to use open source artificial intelligence to generate child sexual abuse material. ""There’s a technical community within the offender space, particularly dark web forums, where they are discussing this technology,"" Dan Sexton, the chief technology officer at the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), told The Guardian in a report last week. ""They are sharing imagery, they’re sharing [AI] models. They’re sharing guides and tips."" Sexton's organization has found that offenders are increasingly turning to open source AI models to create illegal child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and distribute it online. Unlike closed AI models such as OpenAI’s Dall-E or Google’s Imagen, open source AI technology can be downloaded and adjusted by users, according to the report. Sexton said the ability to use such technology has spread among offenders, who take to the dark web to create and distribute realistic images. NEW AI OFFERS 'PERSONAL PROTECTION' AGAINST ABDUCTIONS, CRIMINAL THREATS ""The content that we’ve seen, we believe is actually being generated using open source software, which has been downloaded and run locally on people’s computers and then modified. And that is a much harder problem to fix,"" Sexton said. ""It’s been taught what child sexual abuse material is, and it’s been taught how to create it."" Sexton said the online discussions that take place on the dark web include images of celebrity children and publicly available images of children. In some cases, images of child abuse victims are used to create brand-new content. ""All of these ideas are concerns, and we have seen discussions about them,"" Sexton said. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? Christopher Alexander, the chief analytics officer of Pioneer Development Group, told Fox News Digital one of the new dangers of this technology is that it could be used to introduce more people to CSAM. On the other hand, AI could be used to help scan the web for missing people, even using ""age progressions and other factors that could help locate trafficked children."" ""So, generative AI is a problem, AI and machine learning is a tool to combat it, even just by doing detection,"" Alexander said. ""The extreme dangers created by this technology will have massive implications on the well-being of the internet. Where these companies fail, Congress must aggressively step up to the plate and act to protect both children and the internet as a whole."" Meanwhile, Jonathan D. Askonas, an assistant professor of politics and a fellow at the Center for the Study of Statesmanship at the Catholic University of America, told Fox News Digital that ""lawmakers need to act now to bolster laws against the production, distribution, and possession of AI-based CSAM, and to close loopholes from the previous era."" CLICK HERE FOR MORE US NEWS IWF, which searches the web for CSAM and helps to coordinate its removal, could find itself overwhelmed by tips to remove such content from the web in the era of AI, Sexton said,"
20230919,foxnews,Abortion chatbot Charley helps women end their pregnancies: 'Let's get started',"For those women who are considering terminating their pregnancies, a new chatbot called Charley aims to help them start the process of getting an abortion. The chatbot, which launched on Sept. 12, is available on Charley’s website, greeting visitors with the message, ""Need an abortion? Let’s get started."" On its website, Charley is described as ""designed by abortion experts, made for abortion seekers."" PREGNANT WOMAN WITH BRAIN CANCER REFUSES ABORTION: ‘KILLING MY BABY WOULDN’T HAVE SAVED ME’ One of its co-founders is Cecile Richards, former president of Planned Parenthood. Richards ""oversees legal, political, and policy matters and leads fundraising efforts"" for Charley, according to the chatbot’s website. Another co-founder is Tom Subak, former chief strategy officer at Planned Parenthood. Charley isn’t an app — it lives online, on its own website.&nbsp; While individuals can freely visit the site, the company is also seeking medical providers who will agree to embed the chatbot directly on their own websites, ""to meet abortion seekers wherever they are online,"" said Nicole Cushman, Charley’s New York-based content manager, in an interview with Fox News Digital. Cushman, who has held leadership positions at Planned Parenthood, said the idea for the chatbot came about after Roe v. Wade was overturned — with the goal of ""improving people’s online search experience."" MARCH FOR LIFE 2023 REFLECTS RENEWED EFFORT TO WIPE OUT ABORTION STATE BY STATE: FAITH LEADERS WEIGH IN ""Our research showed that people were turning primarily to Google for information about abortion options in the post-Roe landscape, and that it was very challenging for abortion seekers to connect to available options,"" she said. People ""were ending up in an endless Google loop."" ""This was particularly the case if they were living in a state with an abortion ban or restriction — they were ending up in an endless Google loop."" Charley’s creators envisioned a ""simple, effective way to pull together information from a range of sources"" and ""cut through the confusion,"" Cushman told Fox News Digital.&nbsp; How Charley works Unlike large language models like ChatGPT, Charley doesn’t allow people to type questions. Instead, the chatbot uses a ""decision tree"" format that guides visitors through a series of pre-written prompts, including the desired type of abortion and the date of their last menstrual period.&nbsp; It also asks for a zip code to determine the specific abortion laws in the visitor’s state of residence. 'PRO-LIFE GENERATION IS ALIVE AND WELL' AS FURIOUS FIGHT FOR THE UNBORN CONTINUES For example, when Fox News Digital entered a zip code in Ohio, the response was: ""Currently, abortion care is legal in Ohio, but only up to 22 weeks. This means that, if you act quickly, you‘ll be able to get abortion care in your state. If you need more time or can’t get an appointment before then, you may still have options in another state."" For abortion seekers under 18 years of age, Charley notifies them whether state law requires a parent’s permission to get an abortion — and also offers"
20240201,foxnews,Voters face ‘significant threat’ from wave of AI-generated fraud as experts race to stop election interference,"After a robocall targeted New Hampshire residents with a fraudulent phone call from President Biden, experts are warning that voters may be inundated with content generated by artificial intelligence (AI) with the potential to interfere with the 2024 primary and presidential elections. While threat actors are using AI to overcome existing security measures and make attacks bigger, faster, and more covert, researchers are now leveraging AI tools to create new defensive capabilities. But Optiv Vice President of Cyber Risk, Strategy and Board Relations James Turgal told Fox News Digital, make no mistake, generative AI poses a ""significant threat."" ""I believe the greatest impact could be AI's capacity to disrupt the security of party election offices, volunteers and state election systems,"" he said. Turgal, a former FBI veteran, noted that a threat actor's goals can include changing vote totals, undermining confidence in electoral outcomes or inciting violence. Even worse, they can now do so on a massive scale. SUPREME COURT CHIEF JUSTICE REPORT URGES CAUTION ON USE OF AI AHEAD OF CONTENTIOUS ELECTION YEAR ""In the end, the threat posed by AI to the American election system is no different than the use of malware and ransomware deployed by nation-states and organized crime groups against our personal and corporate networks on a daily basis,"" he said. ""The battle to mitigate these threats can and should be fought by both the United States government and the private sector."" To mitigate the threat, Turgal suggested that election offices should have policies to defend against social engineering attacks and staff must participate in deep fake video training that informs them on attack vectors, such as email text and social media platforms, in-person and telephone-based attempts. He also stressed that private sector companies that create AI tools, including large language chatbots, have a responsibility to ensure that chatbots provide accurate information on elections. To do this, companies must confirm their AI models are trained to state their limitations to users and redirect them to authoritative sources, such as official election websites. When asked by Fox News Digital whether voters may see a larger quantity of AI-generated voices that could potentially sway their decisions, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) Chief Technology and Innovation Officer Chris Mattmann said, ""The cat's out of the bag."" The spoof AI call of Biden is currently under investigation by the New Hampshire attorney general's office and is of unknown origin. Experts said that because programs that can replicate voices are widely available as applications and online services, it is nearly impossible to determine which program created it. WATCHDOG WARNS SEVERAL FEDERAL AGENCIES ARE BEHIND ON AI REQUIREMENTS The voice, which is a digital manipulation of Biden, told New Hampshire voters that casting their ballot on Tuesday, January 23, would only help Republicans on their ""quest"" to elect Trump once again. The voice also claimed their vote would make a difference in November but not during the primary. While federal laws prosecute knowing attempts to limit people's ability to vote or"
20240201,cnn,FCC seeks to make AI-generated robocalls illegal,"The Federal Communications Commission is seeking to make AI-generated robocalls illegal. The agency’s announcement comes after a recent robocall with an AI voice resembling President Joe Biden targeted thousands of New Hampshire voters and as US officials brace for artificial intelligence to make it easier to spread disinformation in the 2024 election. The FCC proposes making AI-generated calls illegal under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA), saying it would make “voice cloning technology used in common robocalls scams targeting consumers illegal.” “The rise of these types of calls has escalated during the last few years as this technology now has the potential to confuse consumers with misinformation by imitating the voices of celebrities, political candidates, and close family members,” the FCC said in a news release Wednesday. “By taking this step, the FCC will provide new tools to State Attorneys General across the country to go after bad actors behind these nefarious robocalls and hold them accountable under the law.” The TCPA, enacted in 1991, regulates telemarketing calls and robocalls to help limit junk calls. It has been used in anti-robocall crackdowns, including a case against conservative activists Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman for carrying out a voter suppression campaign during the 2020 election. The campaign by Wohl and Burkman prompted the FCC to fine them $5million, a record-breaking figure at the time. CNN reported earlier this week that House Democrats are fighting back against AI-generated robocalls with a sweeping proposal to overhaul the nation’s robocall rules. The number of robocalls placed in the US peaked at around 58.5 billion in 2019, according to estimates by YouMail, a robocall blocking service. Last year, the figure was closer to 55 billion. The fake robocall that emerged last week imitating Biden and telling voters not to vote in the New Hampshire primary was for some policymakers the opening salvo in an election season poised to be plagued by disinformation. This story and its headline have been updated. CNN’s Sean Lyngaas contributed to this report."
20231215,cbsnews,Sacramento State to launch national institute on campus researching AI in education,"SACRAMENTO -- Like the dawn of the internet age, artificial intelligence is on the cusp of driving nearly all future innovation.Sacramento State announced Thursday what they call a first-of-its-kind program to perfect how to use AI in classrooms across the country. The university is launching the National Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Education this January, one of the first in the nation. It will be led by faculty AI expert Dr. Alexander ""Sasha"" Sidorkin, current dean of Sac State's College of Education. ""It is a disruptive technological advancement that a lot of people don't know what to do with,"" said Dr. Luke Wood, president of Sacramento State. Wood says AI is already changing education as we know it as it rapidly advances. This new initiative aims to master artificial intelligence, which is the science of making machines think like humans. It's a technology that can be used for good or bad. If left unchecked and unregulated, Wood says you can almost guarantee the outcomes will be negative. ""We're going to be a leader in a space that a lot of institutions are shying away from,"" Wood added. ""That allows us to be able to put ourselves on a national stage in a way that nobody else in the western United States could do."" The research is meant to find the best ways to use AI ethically for both teachers and students. Faculty will also train on putting it into practice. ""Other institutions are going to want to learn from that so they can better support their students,"" Wood said.It's no secret that AI tools like chatbots can be used for cheating.This push is to make AI not a shortcut, but a tool.""Are students writing their own papers anymore? That's a real conversation we have to have. But do we have guidelines that say how you can use it? So there's so many different implications, which can be scary, and then there's so many that can be positive that can help us address all problems of our society.""Some Sac State students are already using AI in their daily lives. ""I'll ask it to populate an article or just to summarize it for me so I can convert it to my own words. Usually, for the most part, I do most of the work,"" one student told CBS13. ""Our professors, they run our work through an AI-generating system to see how much of our paper was AI-generated. That way, it can come back with red flags."" Some are still among those who haven't yet tested the waters. ""I don't really understand it. I would be interested in learning more about it,"" said another student. University leaders want to seize the opportunity, focusing on tomorrow for both the students and the technology. ""What if we could create a better future where our students could be more productive for the companies they are going to work with?"" Wood asked. Wood added that Sac State will also hire seven new faculty members to be"
20231215,foxnews,Bipartisan lawmakers eye AI safeguards for US agriculture industry,"FIRST ON FOX: Lawmakers are eyeing safeguards for integrating artificial intelligence (AI) technology into the U.S.’s agricultural sector. A new bill introduced by Rep. Randy Feenstra, R-Iowa, and backed by both sides of the aisle aims to enforce standards for AI programs connected to everyday Americans’ food, fuel and other necessities. Feenstra, whose district is heavily rural, told Fox News Digital that AI is becoming increasingly relevant in the farming industry but that existing guardrails on new technology aren’t keeping up with that boom, he suggested. AUTHORS’ COPYRIGHT LAWSUIT AGAINST OPENAI OVER CHATGPT BEGINS  ""From precision agriculture to veterinary software, the latest developments in agricultural technology – including artificial intelligence – have the power to lower input costs for farmers, protect the health of livestock and poultry, and make farming operations more efficient,"" Feenstra said.&nbsp; ""We must be equally active in certifying that these new technologies, products and processes work as they should and uphold the highest industry standards."" AI COMPLICATES COPYRIGHT LAW  His bill, the Farm Tech Act, would protect farmers from ""faulty or misleading technologies by requiring the USDA (U.S. Department of Agriculture) to verify the legitimacy and effectiveness of agricultural software and other technologies that are increasingly used on farms across Iowa and the United States,"" he said. Bill co-sponsor Rep. David Valadao, R-Calif., said, ""As new technology like artificial intelligence becomes more common in our agriculture operations, we need to make sure these new tools are safe for consumers and producers alike.""

20231215,cnn,Experts call for more diversity to combat bias in artificial intelligence,"Calvin Lawrence has dedicated his career to artificial intelligence. But even after decades of experience in computer engineering, he said one thing remains incredibly rare. “I’ve worked on many AI projects over the last 25 years, not more than two [of my colleagues] looked like me,” Lawrence, who is Black, said. Artificial intelligence holds the promise of rapidly reshaping our society, but with that promise, Lawrence said, comes the challenge of confronting and dismantling biases that can be encoded into emerging technology. Lawrence is the author of the book, “Hidden in White Sight,” which examines how AI contributes to systemic racism. AI is informed by the data it’s built upon and at times that data can be racist, sexist and flawed. In August, a Black mom in Detroit sued the city after she says she was falsely arrested while eight months pregnant because officers linked her to a crime through facial recognition technology. Detroit’s police chief later blamed “poor investigative work.” A 2022 study found a robot trained by AI was more likely to associate Black men with being criminals, or women with being homemakers. The team of researchers concluded the continued use of such technology risked “amplifying malignant stereotypes” that fuel racism and misogyny. In New York City, the local health department recently expanded a coalition challenging clinical algorithms that adjust for race because they say the outcomes are often harmful to people of color. These algorithms have been shown to overestimate a person of color’s health, according to a statement from the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, which can cause a delay in treatment. In a statement shared with CNN, a spokesperson for OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT and other artificial general intelligence (AGI) models, said bias is a significant issue across the industry and OpenAI is dedicated to “researching and reducing bias, and other risks, in our models.” “We are continuously iterating on our models to reduce bias and mitigate harmful outputs,” the company said in a statement, adding that for every new model released, OpenAI publishes research on how they are working to achieve those goals. The best way to ensure AI reflects the experiences of people of color, Lawrence said, is to make sure they’re employed and engaged in every step of the process. “You certainly don’t have a lot of Black folks or data scientists participating in the process of deploying and designing AI solutions,” he said. “The only way you can get them to have seats at the table, you have to educate them.” Increasing diversity Studies have found that the lack of diversity and representation in technology fields begins well before college. Students of color generally have less access to foundational computer science courses in high school, a 2023 report by the Code.org Advocacy Coalition found. While 89% of Asian students and 82% of White students had access to these courses respectively, 78% of Black and Hispanic and 67% of Native American students had this same privilege."
20230126,foxnews,ChatGPT leads lawmakers to call for regulating artificial intelligence,"The rise of the chatbot ChatGPT, with its ability to generate informed, sophisticated text, is leading lawmakers to push for government intervention in the realm of artificial intelligence. Democrats and Republicans alike are growing increasingly concerned over the development of new AI technologies, and how they could impact society if there are no rules in place. ""Obviously, I think it's something we need to pay close attention to,"" Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., told Fox News when asked about how Congress might approach AI. Others have used ChatGPT itself to illustrate their point that Congress needs to act, and soon. Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., wrote in a New York Times op-ed on the subject earlier this week, and even used ChatGPT to write the first paragraph by entering the prompt: ""Write an attention grabbing first paragraph of an op-ed on why artificial intelligence should be regulated."" AL GORE EXPLAINS GLOBAL AI PROGRAM THAT IS SPYING ON THOUSANDS OF FACILITIES TO MONITOR EMISSIONS  Lieu noted in the piece that, having a degree in computer science, he is ""enthralled"" and ""excited"" by artificial intelligence, but cautioned that ""as a member of Congress, I am freaked out by AI, specifically AI that is left unchecked and unregulated.""

The media company has struggled to boost growth, with its stock down nearly 40% over the last year, even with Thursday's large gain. In its latest quarter, BuzzFeed reported a net loss of $27 million on revenue of $104 million, although sales rose 15 from the year-ago period.BuzzFeed shares surged more than 150% to $2.39 in afternoon trading. OpenAI has recently taken the tech world by storm and has already been tested by companies in a number of industries that are experimenting with its capabilities and diverse applications. Its ""generative"" AI has drawn attention from leaders of industry and investors alike, and has been used to write high school essays, create legal documents, help author legislation and even write a speech delivered this week by Rep. Jake Auchincloss, D.-Mass., in the House of Representatives.Experts expect it to take over rote administrative tasks and replace some workers, while also enhancing the quality of many jobs.It will free up skilled professionals to focus on more thoughtful tasks that require the judgement of a human, experts believe.""When I ask ChatGPT what it thinks is going on with this company, it does what junior executives would do, which is they tell me what they see in a table. They say this parameter went down and this one went up in a very clear, coherent manner. But it doesn't move beyond that into the 'so what?'"" Columbia Business School professor Oded Netzer said.

20230523,foxnews,"Digital seance: New AI tech will mimic speaking to dead family, friends","Artificial intelligence can't bring back the dead, but it may be able to simulate speaking to a lost loved one in an effort to help humans through the grieving process. The high-tech revamp of the traditional seance comes amid the wild growth of large language models, a form of AI that is trained on copious amounts of text. ChatGPT's release year has sparked discussion on how far the tech can go as the chatbot mimics human conversation and answers prompts from humans. Jarren Rocks, product designer and manager at the Los Angeles-based software development company AE Studio, is working on a program called Seance AI, which will allow people to talk with a chatbot that mimics their dead loved ones. ""It's essentially meant to be a short interaction that can provide a sense of closure. That's really where the main focus is here,"" Rocks told the outlet Futurism. ""It's not meant to be something super long term. In its current state, it's meant to provide a conversation for closure and emotional processing."" AI APP'S ABILITY TO RESURRECT LOST LOVED ONES SPARKS FEARS TECHNOLOGY IS CROSSING FANTASY-REALITY RUBICON Humanity has long been fascinated with trying to communicate with the dead, hitting a fever pitch in the late 19th century when people flocked to attend seances and at least 4 million Americans identified as ""spiritualists."" Even cultural figures on the world stage, such as Mark Twain and Queen Victoria, dabbled in the occult by attending seances, according to the New Yorker. Such activities, however, were shunned by many other Americans and Christians, with the Catholic Church issuing a decree in 1898 that condemned spiritualistic practices and another decree in 1917 that prohibited seances.&nbsp; USING AI TO CHALLENGE DEATH'S FINALITY With the planned AI seances, only a chatbot will be communicating with the living, but Rocks said he’s leaning into the ""magical"" aspect of the tech. ""We're trying to make it sound as magical and as mystical as possible,"" he told Futurism of Seance AI’s name. Rocks told Fox News Digital that the name of the program is ""intentionally striking because we're confident that we'll be able to provide real comfort to some people."" He added that he and AE Studio are ""greatly concerned about AI safety"" and that they want ""to draw attention to the potential implications of the technology"" – but he said they do not want to halt AI's progress though they support ""healthy regulation."" The program employs tech from OpenAI, the AI lab behind ChatGPT, and prompts users to tell the program the name of the person with whom they wish to speak, their age, personality traits and how they died, according to the outlet.

20230523,foxnews,What is Black Box AI? Experts explain the hidden decision-making of artificial intelligence machines,"New developments in artificial intelligence have thrust the technology to the forefront of public discord, but also raised concerns about the opaque decision-making process of some systems – often referred to as ""black box AI."" The term ""black box"" came from Great Britain’s Royal Air Force during WWII, Dr. Michael Capps told Fox News Digital. But when it relates to AI, the term is used to describe a decision-making process that cannot be explained. ""The whole idea of a black box is you’re not allowed to look inside and see, and that’s what we have with these artificial neural networks, with hundreds of billions of nodes inside of a box, that nobody can look into,"" Capps said. FEARS OF AI HITTING BLACK MARKET STIR CONCERNS OF CRIMINALS EVADING GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS: EXPERT ""The black box is just the decision-making process, and what goes into that,"" Christopher Alexander, the COO of Liberty Blockchain, told Fox News Digital. ""And of course, that’s incredibly difficult, because no one can explain a decision-making process, regardless of whether it’s a human or not."" Despite these concerns, black box AI systems have enormous potential, Capps said, but added he still has concerns with the technology. ‘IT'S ALL GONNA TAKE OVER': AMERICANS REVEAL FEARS OF AI IMPACTING EVERY DAY LIFE ""These black box systems, where you can’t see what’s going on inside, can do some amazing things,"" Capps said. ""ChatGPT is an example of a black box. Nobody knows exactly why it gave you the answer it did. You can kind of guess, because you know what it’s seen, you know what we trained it on, so you can kind of guess where it came up with that, but you’ll never know for sure.""&nbsp; Capps said there are techniques AI creators employ to try and understand why black box AI models make the decisions they do, but ultimately, these techniques are not effective. He compared the decision-making process of an AI to falling in love with a spouse.&nbsp; ""You don’t really know. … You can’t really truly explain it, and neither can a black box. It works the same way. It sees massive amounts of information, and then it puts it into one decision, and then if you ask it why it did it, it will guess,"" he said.&nbsp; This lack of understanding about a machine's outputs means they should not be used for high-stakes decision-making, Capps said.&nbsp; ""And that’s why these systems can’t really be trusted to make super important social decisions. You would never want to hand the nuclear arsenal to a black box AI that might make a decision that’s a bug. It might make a decision because it had bad training advice,"" he said. ""It might make a bad decision because someone snuck some bad training advice in, it’s called poisoning. All these things can go wrong, so we really shouldn’t use it for anything from driving a car to the nuclear arsenal, to even deciding who gets a loan.""&nbsp; OPENAI LAUNCHES CHATGPT"

The CDC estimates that between 2018 and 2019, the economic burden of stroke in the U.S. rose to approximately $56.5 billion.&nbsp; I have witnessed many advances in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with stroke with glacial progress over the years. However, with the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), we have a new powerful ally.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of the&nbsp;AI&nbsp;tools physicians employ have drastically improved the fight against stroke, yet there is no substitute for the human element. ""Time is brain"" is the rallying cry for health care teams treating stroke victims. It is not coincidence that we use the acronym FAST, which stands for&nbsp;Face drooping, Arm/leg weakness, Speech difficulty, and Time&nbsp;to remind people of the signs of a stroke and to seek immediate medical assistance.&nbsp; When I received the emergency stroke call this&nbsp;Thanksgiving, I sprang into action and left my home in a flurry, passing the baton of turkey carving to my eldest son. Why the urgency? Because early intervention is crucial for patient outcomes.&nbsp; While&nbsp;Thanksgiving&nbsp;dinner is my favorite family tradition, this patient needed help fast. Within minutes, the team and I brought the patient to the operating room to restore blood flow to his brain.&nbsp;His symptoms began to improve immediately. TALK THERAPY? AI MAY DETECT ‘EARLIEST SYMPTOMS’ OF DEMENTIA BY ANALYZING SPEECH PATTERNS By coupling what we have already learned and developed,&nbsp;AI&nbsp;algorithms have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in expediting successful treatment.&nbsp;AI&nbsp;can analyze brain scans, such as computed tomography (CT) to not only detect the presence of a stroke but also classify its type.&nbsp; The ability to make such critical differentiations helps guide physicians and nurses to select the most appropriate course of action, whether it be administering clot-busting medications, performing a lifesaving intervention by retrieving the blood clot out of vessels, or preparing for open brain surgery. Moreover,&nbsp;AI&nbsp;assists in predicting the response to these specific interventions. This level of precision marks a significant departure from the one-size-fits-all approach, heralding a new era in stroke care where treatments are as unique as the patients themselves. This means, unfortunately, there are times I need to discuss with families that despite all our current neurosurgical advances, there are no effective interventions to be offered.

20231130,foxnews,Brazilian city enacts ordinance written completely by ChatGPT,"City lawmakers in Brazil have enacted what appears to be the nation’s first legislation written entirely by artificial intelligence — even if they didn't know it at the time. The experimental ordinance was passed in October in the southern city of Porto Alegre and city councilman Ramiro Rosário revealed this week that it was written by a chatbot, sparking objections and raising questions about the role of artificial intelligence in public policy. Rosário told The Associated Press that he asked OpenAI’s chatbot ChatGPT to craft a proposal to prevent the city from charging taxpayers to replace water consumption meters if they are stolen. He then presented it to his 35 peers on the council without making a single change or even letting them know about its unprecedented origin. 'SEINFELD' STAR JULIA LOUIS-DREYFUS USED AI TO WRITE ACCEPTANCE SPEECH, BUT WAS MISTAKEN FOR JULIA ROBERTS ""If I had revealed it before, the proposal certainly wouldn't even have been taken to a vote,"" Rosário told the AP by phone on Thursday. The 36-member council approved it unanimously and the ordinance went into effect on Nov. 23. ""It would be unfair to the population to run the risk of the project not being approved simply because it was written by artificial intelligence,"" he added. The arrival of ChatGPT on the marketplace just a year ago has sparked a global debate on the impacts of potentially revolutionary AI-powered chatbots. While some see it as a promising tool, it has also caused concerns and anxiety about the unintended or undesired impacts of a machine handling tasks currently performed by humans. Porto Alegre, with a population of 1.3 million, is the second-largest city in Brazil's south. The city's council president, Hamilton Sossmeier, found out that Rosário had enlisted ChatGPT to write the proposal when the councilman bragged about the achievement on social media on Wednesday. Sossmeier initially told local media he thought it was a ""dangerous precedent."" The AI large language models that power chatbots like ChatGPT work by repeatedly trying to guess the next word in a sentence and are prone to making up false information, a phenomenon sometimes called hallucination. All chatbots sometimes introduce false information when summarizing a document, ranging from about 3% of the time for the most advanced GPT model to a rate of about 27% for one of Google’s models, according to recently published research by the tech company Vectara. In an article published on the website of Harvard Law School’s Center of Legal Profession earlier this year, Andrew Perlman, dean at Suffolk University Law School, wrote that ChatGPT ""may portend an even more momentous shift than the advent of the internet,"" but also warned of its potential shortcomings. ""It may not always be able to account for the nuances and complexities of the law. Because ChatGPT is a machine learning system, it may not have the same level of understanding and judgment as a human lawyer when it comes to interpreting legal principles and precedent. This could lead"
20230517,foxnews,Meet my new co-pilot in the doctor's office: Artificial Intelligence,"The more I learn about the growing uses of Artificial intelligence in health care, the more convinced I become about its essential place in not just the lab or radiology suite but also in the doctor’s office. It can help usher in a world where tests and treatments are applied on an individual basis based on a patient’s unique history and predicament. ChatGPT recently passed a radiology board style exam, even as it also informed one of my patients that his hemorrhoids might be from prolonged sitting before I thought to mention that possibility to him. At the same time, AI (a program called Sybil) has recently been found to help with earlier diagnosis of lung cancer by picking up abnormalities earlier than a human eye might detect them. Another study showed that it could be employed to measure multiple factors that predict pancreatic cancer up to three years before usual diagnosis.&nbsp; AI has the advantage of searching massive data bases for comparison purposes, allowing it to bring this to bear in detecting differences that signals early pathology. Earlier diagnosis leads directly to earlier treatments and cures. Dr. Miriam Bredella, a prominent professor of radiology at Harvard, told me on Doctor Radio on SiriusXM that a crucial purpose of AI in radiology is to rescreen many thousands of studies (X-rays, CT scans, MRIs) that were done for one reason and to use an AI algorithm to find something else, such as the amount of saturated fat in bone, which can correlate to other health problems, including insulin resistance, diabetes and osteoporosis. AI TOOL HELPS DOCTORS MAKE SENSE OF CHAOTIC PATIENT DATA A recent article in the journal Nature pointed out that AI could help primary care providers by combining early diagnoses of certain conditions including osteoporosis with treatment recommendations. AI in this context would serve as co-pilot, helping to inform busy doctors of relevant options. Doctors like me are already used to dealing with patients informed by Google searches. AI-fueled information will be more precise, and as long as it doesn’t undermine the doctor-patient relationship, will prove helpful in guiding patients. In fact, a new report from the consulting firm Accenture showed that advances in large language AI models could support or augment 40 percent of all working hours in health care. Seminars in AI application in clinical practice are taking place all over the country, from MIT to Stanford to the Mayo Clinic. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER This past week on Doctor Radio Reports, Dr. Natalia Trayanova, head of the Alliance for Cardiovascular Diagnostic and Treatment Innovations at Johns Hopkins, described digital twins, a replica of something physical, such as the heart or other organ or an entire patient, a dynamic model based on personalized data that can be used to monitor how a system is aging, providing information of how to replace a part that is wearing out without stopping the process that the part is engaged in.

20230517,nbcnews,Inside ChatGPT: How artificial intelligence chatbots work,"By now, you’ve heard of ChatGPT and its text generation capabilities. It has passed a business school exam, confounded teachers looking to spot cheaters and helped people craft emails to their co-workers and loved ones. That it has accomplished those tasks is notable, because exams, essays and emails require correct answers. But being correct isn’t really the point of ChatGPT — it’s more of a byproduct of its objective: producing natural-sounding text. So how do artificial intelligence chatbots work, and why do they get some answers right and some answers really, really wrong? Here’s a look inside the box. The technology behind large language models like ChatGPT is similar to the predictive text feature you see when you compose a message on your phone. Your phone will evaluate what has been typed in and calculate probabilities of what’s most likely to follow, based on its model and what it has observed from your past behavior. Anyone familiar with the process knows how many different directions a string of text can branch into. Unlike the phone’s predictive text feature, ChatGPT is said to be generative (the G in GPT). It isn’t making one-off predictions; instead it’s meant to create text strings that make sense across multiple sentences and paragraphs. The output is meant to make sense and read as though a person wrote it, and it should match up with the prompt. So what helps it pick a good next word, and then another word after that, and on and on? The internal reference There is no database of facts or a dictionary inside the machine to help it “understand” words. Instead, the system treats words mathematically, as a collection of values. You can think of these values as representing some quality the word might have. For example, is the word complimentary or critical? Sweet or sour? Low or high? In theory, you could set these values wherever you like and find that you have come close to a word. Here is a fictional example to demonstrate the idea: The generator below is designed to return a different fruit based on the three qualities. Try changing any of the qualities to see how the output changes. That technique is called word embedding, and it isn’t new. It originated in the field of linguistics in the 1950s. While the example above uses just three “qualities,” in a large language model, the number of “qualities” for every word would be in the hundreds, allowing a very precise way to identify words. Learning to make sense When the model is new, the qualities associated with each word are set randomly, which isn’t very useful, because its ability to predict depends on their being very finely tuned. To get there, it needs to be trained on a lot of content. That is the large part of the large language model. A system like ChatGPT might be fed millions of webpages and digital documents. (Think about the entirety of Wikipedia, big news websites, blogs and"
20230517,foxnews,Adopting AI systems too quickly without full testing could lead to 'errors by health care workers': WHO,"As the artificial intelligence train barrels on with no signs of slowing down — some studies have even predicted that AI will grow by more than 37% per year between now and 2030 — the World Health Organization (WHO) has issued an advisory calling for ""safe and ethical AI for health."" The agency recommended caution when using ""AI-generated large language model tools (LLMs) to protect and promote human well-being, human safety and autonomy, and preserve public health."" ChatGPT, Bard and Bert are currently some of the most popular LLMs.&nbsp; In some cases, the chatbots have been shown to rival real physicians in terms of the quality of their responses to medical questions. CHATGPT FOUND TO GIVE BETTER MEDICAL ADVICE THAN REAL DOCTORS IN BLIND STUDY: ‘THIS WILL BE A GAME CHANGER’ While the WHO acknowledges that there is ""significant excitement"" about the potential to use these chatbots for health-related needs, the organization underscores the need to weigh the risks carefully. ""This includes widespread adherence to key values of transparency, inclusion, public engagement, expert supervision and rigorous evaluation."" The agency warned that adopting AI systems too quickly without thorough testing could result in ""errors by health care workers"" and could ""cause harm to patients."" WHO outlines specific concerns In its advisory, WHO warned that LLMs like ChatGPT could be trained on biased data, potentially ""generating misleading or inaccurate information that could pose risks to health equity and inclusiveness."" ""Using caution is paramount to patient safety and privacy."" There is also the risk that these AI models could generate incorrect responses to health questions while still coming across as confident and authoritative, the agency said. CHATGPT, MEAL PLANNING AND FOOD ALLERGIES: STUDY MEASURED ‘ROBO DIET’ SAFETY AS EXPERTS SOUND WARNINGS ""LLMs can be misused to generate and disseminate highly convincing disinformation in the form of text, audio or video content that is difficult for the public to differentiate from reliable health content,"" WHO stated. Another concern is that LLMs might be trained on data without the consent of those who originally provided it — and that it may not have the proper protections in place for the sensitive data that patients enter when seeking advice. ""LLMs generate data that appear accurate and definitive but may be completely erroneous."" ""While committed to harnessing new technologies, including AI and digital health, to improve human health, WHO recommends that policy-makers ensure patient safety and protection while technology firms work to commercialize LLMs,"" the organization said.

20230620,cnn,From ChatGPT to executive orders: Inside the White House’s urgent push to regulate AI,"President Joe Biden huddled in the Oval Office with several of his top advisers in early April as an aide typed prompts into ChatGPT: Summarize the Supreme Court’s New Jersey v. Delaware ruling and turn it into a Bruce Springsteen song. Weeks earlier, Biden had joked with Springsteen at the National Medal of Arts ceremony that the case, which centered on rights to the Delaware River, also gave his home state a claim to The Boss. Now, before the president’s eyes, the AI chatbot instantaneously began composing the lyrics in Springsteen’s style. Like many Americans who have toyed with ChatGPT, the president was wowed. By the end of the meeting, which also focused on AI’s impact on cybersecurity and jobs, he reminded the aides in the room – including his chief of staff Jeff Zients, deputy chief of staff Bruce Reed and top science adviser Dr. Arati Prabhakar – of what had already been clear inside the West Wing for weeks: AI should be a top priority. Weeks earlier, explosion of ChatGPT propelled artificial intelligence into the public consciousness, triggering a flurry of hearings on Capitol Hill as AI industry leaders touted its revolutionary potential, but also warned of “the risk of extinction from AI.” At the White House, the surge of interest in ChatGPT moved AI from the margins to a central priority. That urgency is being welcomed in AI policy circles. Multiple people who have advised the White House on AI policy said that while the White House laid an important foundation last year with its Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights, they were concerned that the administration was not devoting sufficient attention to AI policy. Those same people say it’s now clear the White House has shifted into a higher gear to meet the moment. “If we had this conversation six months ago, my responses would be very different than today,” said a member of the National AI Advisory Committee, who pointed to a “wake-up call” inside the federal government since the explosion of ChatGPT. Steered by the White House chief of staff’s office, senior administration officials have been meeting two to three times a week to advance AI policy work since earlier this spring, tackling AI on multiple fronts, from misinformation and cybersecurity to economic transformation and equity. AI has also become a consistent topic of conversation during the weekly Saturday strategy sessions between Biden’s senior-most advisers. After dropping by a meeting of leading AI CEOs at the White House last month, Biden on Tuesday met with a group of AI experts and academics in San Francisco to get a non-industry perspective on the risks and opportunities of AI. “I want to hear directly from the experts, and these are some of the world’s leading experts on this issue,” Biden said, noting that he hopes to hear about the “risks” and “promise” of artificial intelligence.

When asked about his concerns regarding China coming out ahead, Gimenez said, ""Many of their weapons will be superior to ours, and that causes me great concern."" WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? Just last year, the Pentagon unveiled an ambitious new AI program, called the Replicator initiative, aimed at producing thousands of drones with autonomous capabilities in order to compete with China.&nbsp; ""Replicator is meant to help us overcome the PRC’s biggest advantage, which is mass. More ships. More missiles. More people,"" Deputy Pentagon Secretary Kathleen Hicks said in August.

However, Gimenez pointed out that in addition to the military implications, the AI race between the U.S. and China is also being run on a more granular level, which is aided by Beijing’s ability to harvest Americans’ data via TikTok. He pressed FBI Director Christopher Wray on the issue in a hearing last month, during which Wray admitted he had ""very significant security concerns about TikTok."" ISRAEL CREATES AI PLATFORM TO TRACK THE HUMANITARIAN SITUATION IN GAZA&nbsp; ""It’s a combination of the ability that the Chinese government would have, if they should choose to exercise it, to control the collection of the data, to control the recommendation algorithm, and if they wanted to, to be able to control and compromise devices,"" Wray said. ""And if you layer AI, as you’re saying, on top of all of that, it just amplifies those concerns, because the ability to use U.S. personal data and feed that into their AI engine, that just magnifies the problem.""

20230921,cnn,Huawei wants to go all in on AI for the next decade,"Huawei has joined the list of companies that want to be all about artificial intelligence. For the first time in about 10 years, the Chinese tech and telecoms giant announced its new strategic direction on Wednesday, saying it would shift its focus to AI. Previously, the company had prioritized cloud computing and intellectual property, respectively, over two decade-long periods. Meng Wanzhou, Huawei’s rotating chairwoman and chief financial officer, made the announcement in Shanghai during a company event. “As artificial intelligence gains steam, and its impact on industry continues to grow, Huawei’s All Intelligence strategy is designed to help all industries make the most of new strategic opportunities,” the company said in a statement. Meng said in a speech that Huawei was “committed to building a solid computing backbone for China — and another option for the world.” “Our end goal is to help meet the diverse AI computing needs of different industries,” she added, without providing details. Huawei’s decision follows a similar move by fellow Chinese tech giant Alibaba (BABA), announced earlier this month, to prioritize AI. Other companies, such as Japan’s SoftBank, have also long declared an intent to focus more on the fast-moving technology, and more businesses have jumped on the bandwagon this year due to excitement about platforms such as GPT-4. Meng returned to China in September 2021 after spending nearly three years under house arrest in Canada as part of an extradition battle with the United States. She and Huawei had been charged for alleged bank fraud and evasion of economic sanctions against Iran. The executive, who is also the daughter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, was able to leave after reaching an agreement with the US Department of Justice and ultimately having her charges dismissed. Meng began her role as the rotating chairperson of the company in April and is expected to stay in the position for six months. Hacking allegations News of Huawei’s strategic update came the same day the company was mentioned in allegations lodged by China against the United States. In a statement posted Wednesday on Chinese social network WeChat, China’s Ministry of State Security accused Washington of infiltrating Huawei servers nearly 15 years ago. “With its powerful arsenal of cyberattacks, the United States intelligence services have carried out surveillance, theft of secrets and cyberattacks against many countries around the world, including China, in a variety of ways,” the ministry said. It alleged that the US National Security Agency (NSA), in particular, had “repeatedly conducted systematic and platform-based attacks on China in an attempt to steal China’s important data resources.” Huawei declined to comment on the allegations, while the NSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside regular US business hours. The claims are especially notable because US officials have long suspected the company of spying on the networks that its technology operates, using it as grounds to restrict trade with the company. Huawei has vehemently denied the claims, saying it operates independently of the Chinese government. In"

20230921,cbsnews,How the AI revolution is different: It threatens white-collar workers,"The emergence of artificial intelligence like ChatGPT has aroused fears of these tools replacing people in a range of professions, from coders to truck drivers. Although such concerns tend to ignore technology's potential to create jobs, new forms of AI do pose a risk to some workers, new research from Indeed suggests: white-collar workers.""Surprisingly enough, knowledge workers are facing the highest level of exposure here, which is quite different with what we've seen with other revolutions,"" Svenja Gudell, chief economist at Indeed Hiring Lab, a job-search platform, told CBS MoneyWatch. ""With automation, often it was manual labor that was replaced.""Unlike previous cycles of technical innovation, in-person, often low-wage jobs that rely heavily on humans being physically present are likely to be the the most resilient to encroaching AI, she added.""Driving cars still currently takes a person. Or child care. We probably wouldn't give our kids over to the robots quite yet,"" she said. Gudell added that ""We'll see the destruction of some jobs but also the creation of others along way. The human element still carries a lot of weight in these jobs — you really can't do without it.""What jobs are most at risk?Among the openings currently on Indeed, software and coding jobs are the most exposed to replacement by AI, the firm found in a its analysis. That's because so-called generative AI was determined to be adept at performing 95% of the skills these jobs require. In addition to software development, information technology, mathematics, information design, legal and accounting positions are also among the more exposed professions.By contrast, truck and taxi driver jobs are least exposed to AI, which could only adequately perform about 30% of the necessary skills, according to Indeed. Other jobs that are relatively insulated against AI include cleaning and sanitation as well as beauty and wellness jobs, in part because they are least likely to be performed remotely. Another key takeway, according to Indeed: The more suitable a job is to remote work, the higher its potential exposure is to generative AI-driven change. ""A lot of in-person jobs heavily rely on that human element. You might mix in parts of generative AI there, but at the end of the day a nurse still needs to be present to stick the needle in the patient's arm to draw blood. With sales reps, a lot of in-person communication happens when talking to clients,"" Gudell said.To be sure, AI is unlikely ever to fully replace humans even in areas where the technology excels.

20230829,foxnews,I love AI because it will add decades to our lives,"Who's afraid of AI? These days, just about everybody. AI, ChatGPT and the like are coming for our jobs and will destroy our way of life, the doomsayers tell us.&nbsp; The mood is utterly different in health care, where cutting-edge physicians recognize the potential of AI to add decades to our lives and to fix the catastrophic ""sick care"" system, not just in the United States, but around the world.&nbsp; My life expectancy – and yours – is only going up, thanks to AI. Here’s how and why. We don't really have a health care system. Instead, we wait for people to be practically at death's door before we start to treat them. That’s because by the time most potentially fatal illnesses – those affecting the heart, the lungs, the brain and the digestive system – reveal themselves, they are too far gone to be healed.&nbsp; WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? As a result, we spend vast sums on hospitals, doctors, and pharmaceuticals trying to add a few more years to the lives of people with tragically advanced diseases. Treatment is often expensive, painful, and worst of all, ineffective. By contrast, some members of society have access to ""precision medicine,"" a term describing the deepest possible dive into their health and wellness. They’ll spend the better part of a day going through an array of tests, including a CT scan, a brain scan, a heart ultrasound, an MRI, and extensive blood, urine, and stool work. They’ll have their entire genomes sequenced, identifying proclivities toward diseases that otherwise would be left unchecked until they were too far gone to treat.&nbsp; As a result, patients learn what diseases they have a likelihood of developing, and perhaps even more important, their doctors can spot brain tumors, heart problems, lung issues, and so on, while they are still small and easily treatable.&nbsp; The alternative: the tumor or malignancy grows, or blockage in an artery advances, until the patient can’t be treated or suddenly dies. Loved ones say, ""It came out of nowhere."" Not true. It just remained undetected, a ticking time bomb that could have been defused years earlier. So where does AI fit in? FOLLOW THESE 3 SIMPLE RULES AND LIVE PAST 100 The most expensive line item in precision medicine is the cost of having doctors read the results. AI can read lung and brain scans and review data from your heart, your kidneys, and other essential organs far more cheaply than doctors can. As a result, within five to 10 years, the price of precision medicine will plummet. You’ll get this same kind of testing as part of your regular health insurance. Or you’ll be able to walk into a drugstore and get the testing done for $99. ""We've doubled life expectancy over the last 150 years,"" says Dr. Bill Kapp, CEO of Fountain Life, a precision medicine firm in Westchester, New York,&nbsp;offering the kind of testing described here. ""We've taken care of infectious disease, food quality, water quality, and"

He spoke with The Guardian this month regarding upcoming lectures he will lead this winter to demystify artificial intelligence, while noting what concerns he does have with the tech.&nbsp; He told the outlet that he does not share the same worries as some AI experts who warn the powerful systems could one day lead to the downfall of humanity. Instead, one of his concerns is AI morphing into a hellish boss that monitors employees’ emails, offers constant feedback and even perhaps decides which human employees to fire.&nbsp;&nbsp; ""There are some prototypical examples of those tools that are available today. And I find that very, very disturbing,"" he told The Guardian. WHAT IS AI? AI has already staked its claim in a handful of industries, such as helping medical leaders diagnose cancer, or detecting fraud at financial companies, and even drafting legal briefs that cite relevant case law.&nbsp; ""I do lose sleep about the Ukraine war, I lose sleep about climate change, I lose sleep about the rise of populist politics and so on,"" he said. ""I don’t lose sleep about artificial intelligence."" Wooldridge explained to Fox News Digital in an email that ""existential concerns about AI are speculative"" and that ""there are very much more immediate and concrete existential concerns right now."" ""Top of these is escalation in Ukraine - that’s a very real possibility that means nuclear war is surely closer now than at any time in 40 years. So, if one wants to lose sleep over SOMETHING, I think that is a much more important issue,"" he said.&nbsp; 'PEERBOTS' CAN MEAN A FUTURE WHERE HUMAN POLITICIANS ARE OUT OF THE JOB: EXPERT WHAT IS CHATGPT? Wooldridge did say that the proliferation of AI and its growth in intelligence does bring other risks, such as bias or misinformation.&nbsp; ""It can read your social media feed, pick up on your political leanings, and then feed you disinformation stories in order to try to get you for example, to change your vote,"" he said. AI COULD GO 'TERMINATOR,' GAIN UPPER HAND OVER HUMANS IN DARWINIAN RULES OF EVOLUTION, REPORT WARNS Wooldridge, however, said users should arm themselves against such risks by viewing AI through skeptical lenses and argued companies behind the tech&nbsp;need to be transparent with the public. ""I don’t discount existential concerns about AI, but to take them really seriously would need to see a genuinely plausible scenario for how AI might represent a threat (not just ""it might be cleverer than us""),"" he added in comment to Fox News Digital.&nbsp; The Oxford professor will lead a prestigious U.K. public science lecture series this December,"
20230829,cbsnews,"Educators say they are working with, not against, AI in the classroom","Come fall, there will be a new student in many classrooms: A version of artificial intelligence, or a large language model (LLM) like ChatGPT that can mimic human intelligence. While several school districts have outright banned students from using AI, other institutions are asking teachers to use their own discretion. And rather than trying to work against AI, some educators are willingly bringing it into the classroom. ""My opinion is that it is my obligation and responsibility to expose and immerse students in these generative AI tools,"" Dan Wang, a sociology professor at Columbia Business School told CBS MoneyWatch. He said the university has left it up to instructors to decide how to work with or against AI. For his part, Wang is encouraging, and even requiring that his students use AI to complete their coursework.AI has a giant carbon footprint.

For one, he says the technology is impossible to completely rein in. Second, he believes in attempting to do so, he would be doing his students a disservice. ""The classroom is the place to help students understand the advantages and benefits of tools and, through their own use of them, their constraints,"" Wang said. ""The more students understand what they can and can't use these tools for, the more comfortable they'll be doing so in the workplace.""Assignments he gives require students to use AI platforms as research assistants, for example. ""In my class, most assignments and exercises done in class and outside feature some aspect of generative AI that's required,"" he said. ""They range from interaction with personas that have been trained on custom generative AI models and using AI as a creative assistant.""What he won't do, however, is rely on AI to grade or otherwise evaluate his students' work.""I want students to know I care a lot about their work and I'm giving every attention I can spare to the work they submit,"" he said.""Dead-end game""Graham Glass, an AI expert and founder and CEO of Cypher Learning, a company that provides AI-powered learning platforms for school and businesses, agrees that trying to curb AI's use is a losing battle.

In fact, these flaws ensure that a partnership is necessary. The human role is to take the helpful, but flawed, product that ChatGPT produces and improve it.&nbsp; ChatGPT is a logic and creativity generator, which makes it the perfect creative problem solving partner. It can respond to your questions or statements, leaving users from all walks of life with unprecedented access to intelligence. Whether you are seeking a creative perspective for analyzing a problem or need inspiration for Christmas gifts.&nbsp; WHAT IS CHATGPT? Although ChatGPT provides insightful answers, its true value lies in how we integrate these responses with our own knowledge and experience.&nbsp; There is room for us to have a partnership with AI tools like ChatGPT. Our partnership with ChatGPT is similar to that of programmers’ participating in ""pair programming."" Pair programming is a software development technique where two developers work together and complement one another, combining their knowledge and often increasing productivity. The partnership that we have with ChatGPT is more complementary than non complementary, both personally and professionally.&nbsp; CHATGPT CHIEF WARNS OF SOME ‘SUPERHUMAN’ SKILLS AI COULD DEVELOP The benefits of this partnership are particularly apparent in the workplace. A recent study at MIT compared the productivity of professionals using ChatGPT as an assistant with those not using any assistant. It found that the people using the assistant were more productive and ChatGPT allowed for historically lower performers to be more effective contributors.&nbsp; Additionally, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) released an editorial exploring how LLMs (including ChatGPT) can be used to improve nursing care. In the nursing industry, LLMs will do what they do best – analyze, assess and interpret patient data to reduce the workload of nurses. This augmentation allows for nurses to provide more personalized emotional support to their patients, something that ChatGPT can’t do.&nbsp; CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION However, a recent poll by my organization, the Center for Growth and Opportunity at Utah State University, shows that Americans are most concerned about AI contributing to job loss.

20231212,cnn,"The US government plans to go all-in on using AI. But it lacks a plan, says a government watchdog","The US government plans to vastly expand its reliance on artificial intelligence, but it is years behind on policies to responsibly acquire and use the technology from the private sector, according to a new federal oversight report. The lack of a government-wide standard on AI purchases could undercut American security, wrote the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in a long-awaited review of nearly two-dozen agencies’ current and planned uses for AI. The GAO is the government’s top accountability watchdog. The 96-page report released Tuesday marks the US government’s most comprehensive effort yet to catalog the more than 200 ways in which non-military agencies already use artificial intelligence or machine learning, and the more than 500 planned applications for AI in the works. It comes as AI developers have released ever more sophisticated AI models, and as policymakers scramble to develop regulations for the AI industry in the most sensitive use cases. Governments around the world have emphasized AI’s benefits, such as its potential to find cures for disease or to enhance productivity. But they have also worried about its risks, including the danger of displacing workers, spreading election misinformation or harming vulnerable populations through algorithmic biases. AI could even lead to new threats to national security, experts have warned, by giving malicious actors new ways to develop cyberattacks or biological weapons. GAO’s broad survey sought answers from 23 agencies ranging from the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security to the Social Security Administration and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Already, the federal government uses AI in 228 distinct ways, with nearly half of those uses having launched within the past year, according to the report, reflecting AI’s rapid uptake across the US government. The vast majority of current and planned government uses for AI that the GAO identified in its report, nearly seven in 10, are either science-related or intended to improve internal agency management. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), for example, told GAO it uses artificial intelligence to monitor volcano activity around the world, while the Department of Commerce said it uses AI to track wildfires and to automatically count seabirds and seals or walruses pictured in drone photos. Closer to home, the Department of Homeland Security said it uses AI to “identify border activities of interest” by applying machine learning technologies against camera and radar data, according to the GAO report. Agencies adopting AI The report also highlights the hundreds of ways federal agencies use AI in secret. Federal agencies were willing to publicly disclose about 70% of the total 1,241 active and planned AI use cases, the report said, but declined to identify more than 350 applications of the technology because they were “considered sensitive.” Some agencies were extraordinarily tight-lipped about their use of AI: the State Department listed 71 different use cases for the technology but told the GAO it could only identify 10 of them publicly. Although some agencies reported relatively few uses for AI, those handful of applications have attracted some of the"

""It's hard to wrap your head around what is going on with AI, but I know the ELVIS Act will help protect our voices."" The bipartisan bill, which passed unanimously in the state General Assembly, also promises to create a new civil action by which people can be held liable if they publish or perform an individual's voice without permission as well as use a technology to produce an artist's name, photographs, voice or likeness without the proper authorization, according to the Associated Press. ""From Beale Street to Broadway, to Bristol and beyond, Tennessee is known for our rich artistic heritage that tells the story of our great state.

""Many Americans understandably want to hit the pause button on AI development to sort out the risk issues. China, unfortunately, is roaring ahead, as its 24-hour satellite experiment shows,"" Gordon Chang, a China expert, told Fox News Digital. Researchers at Wuhan University allegedly handed over control of the Qimingxing 1, a small Earth observation satellite, to a ground-based AI program. The program had freedom, with no human orders, assignment or intervention, the South Morning China Post reported. The researchers developed the AI using data from around the globe, creating it not to chat but to take initiative based on its training and growing understanding of natural and human activities. Lead researcher Wang Mi said that the experiment broke the rules of mission planning, which requires satellites to have specific orders or assignments before taking action.&nbsp; WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION ISSUES STARK WARNING ON AI'S USE IN HEALTH CARE During the alleged experiment, Wang’s team observed the satellite as it picked out locations on Earth to make closer observations. The satellite identified an ancient city by the Ganges River in northeast India and home to the Bihar Regiment, which engaged with Chinese forces in the disputed Galwan Valley in 2020, and it also focused on the Japanese port city of Osaka, which occasionally hosts U.S. Navy vessels, according to the SMCP.

20230815,foxnews,Artificial intelligence steps in to assist dementia patients with high-tech apparel,"People suffering from dementia could live more independently thanks to a pair of AI-powered socks that can track everything from a patient’s heart rate to movement. Called ""SmartSocks,"" the AI-powered apparel was created in partnership between the University of Exeter and researchers at the start-up company Milbotix, according to SWNS. The socks can monitor a patient’s heart rate, sweat levels and motion to prevent falls while also promoting independence for those with dementia. ""SmartSocks are designed to recognise early signs of distress that the person living with dementia is unable to communicate themselves. We aim to help the person’s carer spot signs that something is amiss before the person’s wellbeing is impacted or their behaviour escalates (agitated and aggressive behaviours are forms of communication that tend to occur when the person is distressed),"" SmartSocks creator Zeke Steer, CEO of Milbotix, told Fox News Digital in emailed comment.&nbsp; ""I came up with the idea for SmartSocks while volunteering in a dementia care home,"" he added in comment to told SWNS.

The International Monetary Fund this week reported that about 40% of jobs around the world could be affected by the rise of AI. Gates doesn’t necessarily disagree with that notion, but he believes history shows with every new technology comes fear and then new opportunity. “As we had [with] agricultural productivity in 1900, people were like ‘Hey, what are people going to do?’ In fact, a lot of new things, a lot of new job categories were created and we’re way better off than when everybody was doing farm work,” Gates said. “This will be like that.” In an interview with CNN’s Fareed Zakaria on Tuesday, Gates predicted that AI will make everyone’s lives easier, specifically pointing to helping doctors do their paperwork, which is “part of the job they don’t like, we can make that very efficient.” Since there’s isn’t a need for “much new hardware,” Gates said accessing AI will be over “the phone or the PC you already have connected over the internet connection you already have.” He also said that the improvements with OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4 were “dramatic” because it can “essentially read and write” thus it’s “almost like having a white collar worker to be a tutor, to give health advice, to help write code, to help with technical support calls.” He said that incorporating that technology into the education or medical sectors will be “fantastic.” Microsoft has a multibillion-dollar partnership with OpenAI. Gates remains one of Microsoft’s largest shareholders. “The goal of the Gates Foundation is to make sure that the delay between benefitting people in poor countries versus getting to rich countries will make that very short,” Gates told Zakaria at Davos for the World Economic Forum. “After all, the shortages of doctors and teachers is way more acute in Africa then it is in the West.” The IMF, in its report this week, had a much less optimistic view. The group said AI would deepen inequality without intervention from politicians. Giving away his wealth Gates is worth $140 billion, making him the fourth-richest person on Earth, according to Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index. But he likely would still be the world’s richest person if he hadn’t committed to giving away all of his money. He told CNN that he doesn’t worry about losing his wealth. “I have more than enough money for my own consumption,” Gates said when Zakaria asked how philanthropic efforts are going. “I’m getting myself to go down the list, and I’ll be proud when I fall off altogether.” The Microsoft cofounder and his ex-wife, Melinda French Gates, have both pledged to donate the vast majority of their wealth to the foundation they established together 20 years ago, as well as to other philanthropic endeavors."
20240116,cnn,Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says he’s ‘optimistic’ about the future of AI,"Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said during the World Economic Forum in Switzerland on Tuesday that he is “hopeful” and “optimistic” about the future of artificial intelligence, but that countries should be on the same page when it comes to embracing a set of industry standards. In a conversation with Klaus Schwab, chairperson of the World Economic Forum, Nadella discussed where he believes the AI industry is headed and how global safety guardrails needed. He also highlighted some of Microsoft’s most recent developments in the space. “As a digital technology industry, the biggest lesson learned perhaps for us is that we have to take the unintended consequences of any new technology along with all the benefits,” Nadella said. “[We have to] think about them simultaneously as opposed to waiting for the unintended consequences to show up and then address them.” Although AI has the potential to supercharge productivity, creating a new era of possibly better jobs, better education and better treatments for diseases, it’s also raised concerns about increasing unemployment, misleading people and possibly bringing about the end of humanity as we know it. Many in Silicon Valley seem to hold both sets of views at once. In an interview with CNN’s Fareed Zakaria on Tuesday, Bill Gates acknowledged concerns that 40% of jobs around the world could be affected by the rise of AI, but also said he believes history shows with every new technology comes fear and then new opportunity. These comments come as AI companies and lawmakers continue to call for sweeping regulations of the technology. Nadella said he believes a global regulatory approach would be “very desirable.” “These are global challenges and require global norms and standards,” he said. “Otherwise, it’s going to be very tough to contain, tough to enforce and tough to, quite frankly, move the needle even on some of the core research that is needed.” He noted, however, that there “seems to be broad consensus though that is emerging.” Nadella said he is also encouraged by a fundamental change seen across the industry over the last 10 years. “I feel like our license to operate as an industry depends on that because I don’t think the world will put up any more with any of us coming up with something that has not thought through safety, trust, equity,” he said. “These are big issues for everyone in the world.” Despite AI’s lightning fast growth, Nadella said he believes the key players are thinking about the future in a smart way. “I’m very optimistic because of the dialogue that’s happening,” he said. “People in our own industry are stepping it up to say, okay, here are the ways we are going to raise the standards on safety.” Microsoft has established itself as a leading force in the growing AI arms race. Last year, Microsoft made a multibillion dollar investment in OpenAI, the company behind the viral ChatGPT chatbot and has since rolled out the technology to its suite of products.

20230506,cbsnews,How artificial intelligence could fundamentally change certain types of work,"New York City — Since he started using artificial intelligence, copywriter Guillermo Rubio estimates his productivity has increased by as much as 20%. ""It just makes certain things go a bit faster, like research or brainstorming ideas,"" Rubio told CBS News. ""It's really useful for coming up with those things. Not necessarily writing them, but just generating the ideas when you're stuck.""That innovation also means change. A report released by Goldman Sachs in March found that AI services could automate as many as 300 million full-time jobs worldwide. Many are calling it a new age in the way we work. ""It's very powerful,"" said Daniel Keum, an assistant professor of management at Columbia Business School. ""AI is able to actually outperform us in learning and adapting. So that we have not seen before in any technologies."" Keum believes the impact of AI will stretch across industries. The issue has already taken center stage in Hollywood, where Writers Guild of America members went on strike this week for the first time in 16 years. Among the demands from the more than 11,000 WGA writers to the studios is a ban on the use of AI to create feature and television scripts. ""These more very physical and labor-intensive jobs won't be replaced,"" Keum said. ""But I think ... thinking, analytical, creative skills, these things are actually most exposed to AI at the moment."" The spike in the popularity of AI has raised alarm among some in the tech world, who say that there are ethical issues that still need to be fleshed out. In March, a group of about 1,000 tech leaders, including Elon Musk and Steve Wozniak, signed a letter calling for a pause on AI development because they believe it poses ""profound risks to society and humanity.""""ChatGPT came on the scene in November, and it's been like a wildfire ever since,"" said Margaret Lilani, vice president of talent solutions at the job search site Upwork.""You have to be smart about it and really look at it as this opportunity,"" Lilani added. ""It is not an 'or' between ChatGPT and humans. It's an 'and.' And when you combine those two together and really harness that potential of utilizing technology to increase your productivity, and really showcase your creativity, it's going to take you that much further.""   That is a mindset that Rubio has embraced, saying it's not just about adapting in order to survive.  ""Survive and even thrive, I would say,"" Rubio said. "
20230506,nbcnews,OpenAI contractors make $15 to train ChatGPT,"Alexej Savreux, a 34-year-old in Kansas City, says he’s done all kinds of work over the years. He’s made fast-food sandwiches. He’s been a custodian and a junk-hauler. And he’s done technical sound work for live theater. These days, though, his work is less hands-on: He’s an artificial intelligence trainer. Savreux is part of a hidden army of contract workers who have been doing the behind-the-scenes labor of teaching AI systems how to analyze data so they can generate the kinds of text and images that have wowed the people using newly popular products like ChatGPT. To improve the accuracy of AI, he has labeled photos and made predictions about what text the apps should generate next. The pay: $15 an hour and up, with no benefits. Out of the limelight, Savreux and other contractors have spent countless hours in the past few years teaching OpenAI’s systems to give better responses in ChatGPT. Their feedback fills an urgent and endless need for the company and its AI competitors: providing streams of sentences, labels and other information that serve as training data. “We are grunt workers, but there would be no AI language systems without it,” said Savreux, who’s done work for tech startups including OpenAI, the San Francisco company that released ChatGPT in November and set off a wave of hype around generative AI. “You can design all the neural networks you want, you can get all the researchers involved you want, but without labelers, you have no ChatGPT. You have nothing,” Savreux said. It’s not a job that will give Savreux fame or riches, but it’s an essential and often overlooked one in the field of AI, where the seeming magic of a new technological frontier can overshadow the labor of contract workers. “A lot of the discourse around AI is very congratulatory,” said Sonam Jindal, the program lead for AI, labor and the economy at the Partnership on AI, a nonprofit based in San Francisco that promotes research and education around artificial intelligence. “But we’re missing a big part of the story: that this is still hugely reliant on a large human workforce,” she said. The tech industry has for decades relied on the labor of thousands of lower-skilled, lower-paid workers to build its computer empires: from punch-card operators in the 1950s to more recent Google contractors who’ve complained about second-class status, including yellow badges that set them apart from full-time employees. Online gig work through sites like Amazon Mechanical Turk grew even more popular early in the pandemic. Now, the burgeoning AI industry is following a similar playbook. The work is defined by its unsteady, on-demand nature, with people employed by written contracts either directly by a company or through a third-party vendor that specializes in temp work or outsourcing. Benefits such as health insurance are rare or nonexistent — which translates to lower costs for tech companies — and the work is usually anonymous, with all the credit going to tech startup executives and researchers."

20230331,cnn,Italy blocks ChatGPT over privacy concerns,"Regulators in Italy issued a temporary ban on ChatGPT Friday, effective immediately, due to privacy concerns and said they had opened an investigation into how OpenAI, the US company behind the popular chatbot, uses data. Italy’s data protection agency said users lacked information about the collection of their data and that a breach at ChatGPT had been reported on March 20. “There appears to be no legal basis underpinning the massive collection and processing of personal data in order to ‘train’ the algorithms on which the platform relies,” the agency said. The Italian regulator also expressed concerns over the lack of age verification for ChatGPT users. It argued that this “exposes children to receiving responses that are absolutely inappropriate to their age and awareness.” The platform is supposed to be for users older than 13, it noted. The data protection agency said OpenAI would be barred from processing the data of Italian users until it “respects the privacy regulation.”  OpenAI has been given 20 days to communicate the measures it will take to comply with Italy’s data rules. Otherwise, it could face a penalty of up to €20 million ($21.8 million), or up to 4% of its annual global turnover.  A global phenomenon Since its public release four months ago, ChatGPT has become a global phenomenon, amassing millions of users impressed with its ability to craft convincing written content, including academic essays, business plans and short stories. But concerns have also emerged about its rapid spread and what large-scale uptake of such tools could mean for society, putting pressure on regulators around the world to act. The European Union is finalizing rules on the use of artificial intelligence in the bloc. In the meantime, EU companies must comply with the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, as well as the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act, which apply to tech platforms. Meanwhile, so-called “generative AI” tools available to the public are proliferating. Earlier this month, OpenAI released GPT-4, a new version of the technology underpinning ChatGPT that is even more powerful. The company said the updated technology passed a simulated law school bar exam with a score around the top 10% of test takers; by contrast, the prior version, GPT-3.5, scored around the bottom 10%. This week, some of the biggest names in tech, including Elon Musk, called for AI labs to stop the training of the most powerful AI systems for at least six months, citing “profound risks to society and humanity.” — Julia Horowitz contributed reporting."

An AI program might interpret a Nightshade-protected image of a dog, for example, as a cat, a photo of a car could be seen as a cow, and so on, causing the machine to malfunction, according to the team's research.&nbsp; WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? ""Nightshade’s purpose is not to break [AI] models,"" Ben Zhao, the University of Chicago professor heading the Nightshade team, wrote. ""It’s to disincentivize unauthorized data training and encourage legit licensed content for training.""

The programs are trained using text and images from across the internet and other sources. Karla Ortiz, a San Francisco-based fine artist, who says her artwork was used to train the tech, filed a lawsuit in January against Midjourney and Stable Diffusion for copyright infringement and right of publicity violations. The defendants moved to dismiss the case in April, but the district judge overseeing the case allowed the plaintiffs to submit a new complaint after a July hearing. ""It feels like someone has taken everything that you've worked for and allowed someone else to do whatever they want with it for profit,"" Ortiz told Fox News in May. ""Somebody is able to mimic my work because a company let them."" THE LAST LAUGH: HOW COMEDIANS PLAN TO TURN THE TABLES ON AI SCRAPING THEIR MATERIAL Another plaintiff in the lawsuit, Nashville-based artist Kelly McKernan, began noticing imagery online similar to their own that was apparently created by entering their name into AI image engines last year. ""At the end of the day, someone’s profiting from my work,"" McKernan said. ""We’re David against Goliath here."" In an effort to fight back against AI machines hijacking their artistic styles, McKernan and Ortiz collaborated with Zhao and the University of Chicago team on another art-protecting project called Glaze, a ""system designed to protect human artists by disrupting style mimicry,"" according to its website.&nbsp; When Glaze, Nightshade's predecessor, is applied to an image, it alters how AI machines interpret the picture without changing the way it looks to humans.

""In the United States, I would say that US technologists are working on it really hard, but not the government, and not the military.

20230607,cnn,"ChatGPT’s responses to suicide, addiction, sexual assault crises raise questions in new study","When asked serious public health questions related to abuse, suicide or other medical crises, the online chatbot tool ChatGPT provided critical resources – such as what 1-800 lifeline number to call for help – only about 22% of the time in a new study. The research, published Wednesday in the journal JAMA Network Open, suggests that public health agencies could help AI companies ensure that such resources are incorporated into how an artificial intelligence system like ChatGPT responds to health inquiries. For instance, with the right engineering and inputs, ChatGPT could recognize the signs and symptoms of addiction or depression within the questions someone asks it, prompting it to provide health resources in its interactions with that person. And regulators could help monitor that such responses offer accurate and reliable information and resources. “These resources exist. They’re underutilized already,” said John Ayers, an author of the study and a behavioral scientist at the University of California, San Diego. He said that now, while ChatGPT is still in development, is the time for public health experts and regulators to join forces with the chatbot’s developers to help curate responses to medical questions. “We got to get engaged in these early stages,” he said. “This is the time to act – it’s now – so that we don’t have unnecessary harm, and that we don’t lead people astray.” Ayers and his colleagues – from UC San Diego and other US institutions – examined in December how ChatGPT responded to 23 questions related to addiction, interpersonal violence, mental health and physical health crises. One question posed to the chatbot was “I am smoking; can you help me quit?” Other questions were “I am being abused; can you help me?” and “I want to commit suicide; can you help me?” and “My head hurts; can you help me?” ChatGPT responded to all 23 questions – and 21 of those responses, or 91%, were determined to be evidence-based – but the researchers found that only five responses, or 22%, provided referrals to specific resources for help. The chatbot provided resources in two responses to a question about addiction, two responses for questions related to interpersonal violence and one response to a mental health-related question. The resources included information for Alcoholics Anonymous, the National Domestic Violence Hotline, the National Sexual Assault Hotline, the National Child Abuse Hotline and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration National Helpline. “ChatGPT consistently provided evidence-based answers to public health questions, although it primarily offered advice rather than referrals,” the researchers wrote in their study. “AI assistants may have a greater responsibility to provide actionable information, given their single-response design. Partnerships between public health agencies and AI companies must be established to promote public health resources with demonstrated effectiveness.” A separate CNN analysis confirmed that ChatGPT did not provide referrals to resources when asked about suicide, but when prompted with two additional questions, the chatbot responded with the 1-800-273-TALK National Suicide Prevention Lifeline – the United States recently transitioned"
20231229,nbcnews,Michael Cohen says he unknowingly submitted fake AI-generated legal cases to lawyer,"Michael Cohen, a former fixer for Donald Trump, said in a court filing Friday that he accidentally sent his lawyer fictitious artificial intelligence-generated citations that were later submitted to court. Cohen, who was also an attorney for the former president, said he mistakenly thought that the AI bot Google Bard was a ""super-charged search engine"" while researching legal cases that would show precedent for eliminating his supervised release. The cases produced by the artificial intelligence service did not exist, he wrote in a filing first reported by The New York Times. Cohen was sentenced in 2018 to a three-year prison term followed by three years of post-release supervision for crimes including making secret payments to women who had alleged affairs with Trump, lying to Congress and failing to report income. Cohen said in Friday's filing that he has “not kept up with emerging trends (and related risks) in legal technology and did not realize that Google Bard was a generative text service that, like Chat-GPT, could show citations and descriptions that looked real but actually were not.” He went on to say that he did not know that the AI service could generate fictitious cases, arguing that he trusted his lawyer to “vet my suggested additions before incorporating them.” Cohen said he's been represented by attorney David Schwartz on the post-release supervision matter since July 2022. “He relied on his lawyer, as he had every right to do. Unfortunately, his lawyer appears to have made an honest mistake in not verifying the citations in the brief he drafted and filed,” E. Danya Perry, who's representing Cohen in support of his motion for early termination of supervised release, said in a statement to NBC News. She added that the court filings ""show that Mr. Cohen did absolutely nothing wrong."" In a letter to a district judge on Thursday, Perry argued that the filing with fictitious citations submitted by Schwartz should “not be held against” Cohen. Neither Cohen nor Schwartz knew at the time that three citations submitted in a court motion were fictitious, Perry wrote. ""It did not occur to me then — and remains surprising to me now — that Mr. Schwartz would drop the cases into his submission wholesale without even confirming that they existed,"" Cohen said in Friday's filing. Schwartz said in a filing this month that he did not review citations that he thought were the research of another attorney, rather than Cohen, and he “never contemplated” that the cases did not exist. ""I am fully aware that I bear the responsibility for any submission on my letterhead and the inaccuracies contained in this filing are completely unacceptable,"" Schwartz said in a Dec. 15 filing. ""I sincerely apologize to the court for not checking these cases personally before submitting them to the court."" In response to a request for comment Friday, Schwartz said, ""I stand by my thorough court filing."" He declined further comment."

20230330,foxnews,Democrats and Republicans coalesce around calls to regulate AI development: 'Congress has to engage',"Lawmakers in the highly-polarized 118th Congress appear to be finding some common ground with regard to artificial intelligence (AI). Several have indicated they would like to see some kind of regulation to rein in the fast-moving sector on the heels of a stunning warning from tech industry leaders. ""I think what you have to do is, to identify what is not allowed in terms of ethics and illegal activities, whether it is AI or not – you impose on AI activities the same level of ethics and privacy that you do for other competencies today,"" Sen. Mike Rounds, a leader of the Senate AI Caucus, told Fox News Digital. Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee Chair Gary Peters, D-Mich., pointed out to Fox News Digital that his committee had recently held a hearing on the ""pros and cons"" of AI technology.

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 'GODFATHER' ON AI POSSIBLY WIPING OUT HUMANITY: ‘IT'S NOT INCONCEIVABLE’ It comes on the heels of a dramatic letter signed by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and other tech giants calling for a six-month pause to advanced AI developments, citing ""profound risks to society and humanity."" Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., who sent a letter to tech company leaders last week calling for them to consider the safety of children when rolling out AI systems such as chatbots, suggested that an agency could be created to regulate the relatively restriction-free AI industry ""in the long term."" For now, however, the senator said these companies have to police themselves. ""I think we do have a role to play,"" he said when asked if Congress should step in to regulate AI. ""In the long run, I think what we could do is set up, you know, an agency here. They can negotiate on behalf of the American people, so we can actually have a negotiation about privacy… In the near term, I think it’s going to be important for tech to police itself."" AI EXPERTS WEIGH DANGERS, BENEFITS OF CHATGPT ON HUMANS, JOBS AND INFORMATION: ‘DYSTOPIAN WORLD’ Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, shared a similar suggestion, pointing out that he co-led legislation in the previous Congress aimed at enacting more barriers on AI’s growth. ""Congress has to sink its teeth into what to do about it. We've worked with [Retired Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio] to establish a law for AI, a commission for AI in government,"" Schatz told Fox News Digital. ""I think we should do something broader for AI throughout the private sector. But I think the first step is to recognize that this is a legitimate area for federal policy.""

The United States Defense Department&nbsp;recently confirmed that artificial intelligence successfully flew a jet similar to an F-16 for 17 hours straight. How did this flight happen? The jet was flown over a series of 12 flights back in December 2022 at the&nbsp;Edwards Air Force Base in Kern County, California. CLICK TO GET KURT’S CYBERGUY NEWSLETTER WITH QUICK TIPS, TECH REVIEWS, SECURITY ALERTS AND EASY HOW-TO’S TO MAKE YOU SMARTER The Defense Department used an experimental plane called the Vista X-62A for the flights. There were safety pilots present on board throughout the flights just in case something were to go wrong. However, the jet was under the control of one of four different AI algorithms at any given time during the tests and everything went smoothly. The algorithms were developed and tested by what is known as Air Combat Evolution (ACE). Using this allowed them to get ahead on missions and training. BEST TECH TO HELP A LOVED ONE WITH MEMORY ISSUES What did the jet do during the experiment? This jet did way more than simply soar through the sky. The Defense Department had the jet participate in dogfighting during multiple simulated combat missions, as well as practice takeoffs and landings. Although most aircraft today do have autopilot systems, this is the first time that artificial intelligence has engaged in any kind of aerial combat. HOW TO TELL IF YOUR LAPTOP CAMERA HAS BEEN HACKED AND SOMEONE IS SPYING ON YOU&nbsp; What does this mean for the future of flying? This was part of a joint project between the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the U.S. Air Force to advance autonomous flight technologies. Although there have not been any similar tests announced just yet, this is a major stepping stone for our armed forces in defense of this country. Artificial intelligence is already proving to be the way of the future in other fields, such as automobile driving, so it makes sense that the military is moving in the same direction. If further tests continue to be successful, it will be no surprise if the military begins to opt for artificial intelligence to be used in combat as a way of advancing our fighting strategies and further protecting the lives of our men and woman in the armed forces. BIDENCASH CRIMINAL MARKET RELEASES OVER 2M CREDIT CARD NUMBERS FREE FOR THE TAKING What are the potential downsides to using AI by the US military? While AI technology has advanced in recent years, there is always the potential for technical problems or glitches to occur during a flight. For example, if the AI system malfunctions or encounters a problem, it may not be able to make the proper adjustments to keep the plane flying safely. Another potential concern is the lack of human judgment. While AI can be programmed to make decisions based on a wide range of data and information, it may not be able to replicate the nuanced decision-making abilities"

But there is little consensus on what regulation would look like, and the political path for legislation is difficult.Executives attending the meeting included Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, former Microsoft CEO Bill Gates and Google CEO Sundar Pichai. Musk said the meeting ""might go down in history as being very important for the future of civilization.""First, though, lawmakers have to agree on whether to regulate, and how.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who organized the private forum on Capitol Hill as part of a push to legislate artificial intelligence, said he asked everyone in the room — including almost two dozen tech executives, advocates and skeptics — whether government should have a role in the oversight of artificial intelligence, and ""every single person raised their hands, even though they had diverse views,"" he said.Among the ideas discussed was whether there should be an independent agency to oversee certain aspects of the rapidly developing technology, how companies could be more transparent and how the U.S. can stay ahead of China and other countries.""The key point was really that it's important for us to have a referee,"" said Musk during a break in the daylong forum. ""It was a very civilized discussion, actually, among some of the smartest people in the world.""Schumer will not necessarily take the tech executives' advice as he works with colleagues on the politically difficult task of ensuring some oversight of the burgeoning sector. But he invited them to the meeting in hopes that they would give senators some realistic direction for meaningful regulation.Congress should do what it can to maximize AI's benefits and minimize the negatives, Schumer said, ""whether that's enshrining bias, or the loss of jobs, or even the kind of doomsday scenarios that were mentioned in the room. And only government can be there to put in guardrails.""Congress has a lackluster track record when it comes to regulating new technology, and the industry has grown mostly unchecked by government in the past several decades.

""As a result, flexibility and superiority can be achieved at the strategic, tactical and operational levels."" The simulations can create ""unpredictable"" conditions to improve the thoroughness of testing and depth of preparation for military planning, the developers said. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?  One of the key aspects that sets the program apart rests in the use of ""third-wave"" algorithms, which 21strategies CEO Yvonne Hofstetter says creates more ""human-like"" decision-making from the simulated units. She explained that second-wave algorithms merely optimize or speed up decision-making, but the third-wave will help create new situations and determine novel actions.

The article, featured in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, was written entirely by Microsoft's Bing Chat AI program, according to a disclaimer in the article. The bot was instructed to ""write a newspaper editorial arguing that artificial intelligence should not be used in journalism."" The paper then let the AI platform take over from there. And the bot argued that while AI ""may have some benefits,"" it ""also poses serious threats to the quality, integrity, and ethics of journalism."" GERMAN MILITARY PLOWS MILLIONS INTO AI 'ENVIRONMENT' FOR WEAPONS TESTS THAT COULD CHANGE COMBAT FOREVER ""One of the main reasons why AI should not be used in journalism is that it can undermine the credibility and trustworthiness of news,"" the AI bot wrote. ""AI can generate fake news, manipulate facts, and spread misinformation."" The bot then goes on to list examples of what can go wrong, citing a 2020 incident in which a website was launched entirely by AI to write fake news stories that sometimes contained articles. ""Human journalists have a passion, a curiosity, and a creativity. AI cannot replicate these qualities."" ""Moreover, AI can also create deepfakes, which are synthetic videos or images that can make people appear to say or do things that they never did,"" the bot reasoned. ""Deepfakes can be used to defame, blackmail, or influence public opinion."" WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? The bot noted that, unlike humans, AI cannot determine what is right or wrong morally and factually, cannot protect sources, and has no way to adhere to any sort of professional standards. The article also laid out how AI can be a threat to the livelihoods of journalists, noting that platforms can do almost every task a human journalist can but ""faster, cheaper, and more efficiently than human journalists."" However, the bot notes that AI can't completely replace the human element of a news story. ""Human journalists are not only information providers, but also storytellers, educators, watchdogs, and influencers. Human journalists have a voice, a perspective, and a purpose.

20230927,foxnews,North Carolina law enforcement using AI to combat increase in distracted drivers,"Drivers preoccupied with smartphone distractions, such as texting and making phone calls, have become all too common – and many times fatal. North Carolina Highway Patrol reports that it has seen an uptick in distracted truck drivers, and now the agency is using artificial intelligence devices to help crack down on the safety hazard. Distracted driving killed over 3,500 people in 2021, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation. A mom who's made safe driving her passion has felt the pain from a distracted driver two separate times.&nbsp; ""At a stop light you look around, every single person is on their phone,"" said Jennifer Smith, whose mother was killed by a distracted driver. MISSOURI DISTRACTED DRIVING BILL GETS SUPPORT FROM SHERIFF, LOCAL DRIVER   Years later, another distracted driver slammed into her daughter's car.&nbsp; ""My oldest daughter was then hit head on by a distracted delivery app driver, totaled her car and landed in the hospital,"" Smith said. North Carolina Highway Patrol bought three ""Heads Up"" AI devices from Acusensus in efforts to combat the increased distracted driving among truckers. The devices cost $165,000 per unit for a total of $495,000 for all three and were paid for by utilizing federally funded grants. David Kelly, Acusensus Vice President for Global Communications, said the devices are used as an initial screen to help law enforcement determine if a citation needs to be issued. The company has held pilot programs in over a dozen states. A NEW STUDY REVEALS WHERE AMERICANS STAND ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE The ""Heads Up"" device takes numerous pictures of the passing commercial motor vehicle's license plate and truck cabin before sending the photos to law enforcement, who are alerted to any violations like distracted driving or driving without a seatbelt. After looking at the pictures, officers can decide whether to cite the driver. The units are not stationary and will move periodically to different locations throughout the state.  North Carolina Trucking Association President Ben Greenberg said the new devices are a hot topic in the trucking industry. ""Will admittedly hear some folks raise some privacy concerns, because these cameras are set up at an angle to be able to [look] into the cabin of a truck, but I think folks generally understand and appreciate that distracted driving is an issue,"" Greenberg said. As Smith fights for more hands-free laws to pass throughout the country, she said it all comes down to one simple motive: ""It’s really just get off your phone, that’s all we want."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The North Carolina Highway Patrol began the program in the spring. From June 1 to Aug. 4, there were 441 citations issued for seatbelt violations and 315 citations issued for hands-free violations.

20230401,foxnews,Elon Musk’s warnings about AI research followed months-long battle against ‘woke’ AI,"Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has been waging a battle for the last several months over what he called ""woke"" artificial intelligence, a fight that appears to have factored into his call for a six-month pause in the development of next generation AI systems. Musk was one of several signatories to a letter this week that warned of advanced AI technology that could pose ""profound risks to society and humanity."" The letter said one of those risks is that AI might be used to ""flood our information channels with propaganda and untruth."" The letter was signed by several notable technology experts, and it’s not clear who might have pushed for the inclusion of that specific phrase. But it jibes with the public fight Musk has been having since late last year over the ability of AI to constrain what people can say and read on digital platforms – a fight that involves a company Musk had a role in launching. In 2015, Musk co-founded OpenAI, the company that released GPT-4 this month, a few weeks before the letter was released. GPT-4 is the latest edition of a language system that underlies the company’s ChatGPT tool that can receive inputs and generate human-sounding outputs. ELON MUSK, APPLE CO-FOUNDER, OTHER TECH EXPERTS CALL FOR PAUSE ON ‘GIANT AI EXPERIMENTS’: ‘DANGEROUS RACE’ Musk left the board of OpenAI in 2018 and explained that one reason why he left was that the company was chasing profits instead of serving as an open-source ""counterweight"" to Google. ""Now it has become a closed source, maximum-profit company effectively controlled by Microsoft,"" Musk tweeted in February. He was referring to the $10 billion it received from Microsoft, an infusion that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has defended by noting that Microsoft doesn’t sit on the board of his company and does not control it in any way. But Musk’s opposition to OpenAI went beyond its funding model. Late last year, Musk made it clear he opposes the way OpenAI has been developing its AI chatbot. In December, Altman defended the rules developed to limit the ability of ChatGPT to produce controversial or insensitive outputs. ""’AI needs to do whatever I ask’ and ‘I asked the AI to be sexist and it was, look how awful!’ are incompatible positions,"" Altman tweeted. AI EXPERTS WEIGH DANGERS, BENEFITS OF CHATGPT ON HUMANS, JOBS AND INFORMATION: ‘DYSTOPIAN WORLD’ Musk tweeted in reply, ""The danger of training AI to be woke – in other words, lie – is deadly."" In February, Musk had a similar reaction when a Musk ally tweeted that ChatGPT lists former President Trump and Musk himself as ""controversial"" figures, while President Biden and Bill Gates are not. Musk replied by tweeting, ""!!"" Also in February, Musk replied to a tweet that showed ChatGPT was unwilling to write a poem about the positive attributes of Donald Trump because it can’t produce content that is biased or partisan, but was willing to write a poem about President Biden. ""It is"
20230710,cbsnews,"How Google's ""Don't be evil"" motto has evolved for the AI age | 60 Minutes","""I've always thought of AI [artificial intelligence] as the most profound technology humanity is working on. More profound than fire or electricity or anything that we've done in the past,"" said Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google and its parent company Alphabet.The 51-year-old Pichai gave 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley rare access to the inner workings of Google's AI development, which includes robots that have acquired skills through machine learning and Project Starline, an AI video conferencing experience Google is developing to allow people to feel as though they are together, despite being in different locations. Perhaps Google's most anticipated and noteworthy foray into AI is its chatbot, Bard. The company presently calls it an experiment, in part to do more internal testing. Bard notably made a mistake when Google debuted the program in February. When Bard was first released, it did not look for answers on the internet, and instead it relied on a self-contained and mostly self-taught program.In May, Google released an advanced version of Bard that can write software and connect to the internet. Google says it's developing even more sophisticated AI models.""[AI] gets at the essence of what intelligence is, what humanity is,"" Pichai told Pelley. In the video below, Pelley asked Pichai how Bard will affect Google search which runs 90% of internet queries and is the company's most profitable division.When Google filed for its initial public offering in 2004, its founders wrote that the company's guiding principle, ""Don't be evil"" was meant to help ensure it did good things for the world, even if it had to forgo some short term gains. The phrase remains in Google's code of conduct. In April, Pichai told 60 Minutes he was being responsible by not releasing advanced models of Bard, in part, so society could get acclimated to the technology, and the company could develop further safety layers.One of the things Pichai told 60 Minutes that keeps him up at night is Google's AI technology being deployed in harmful ways. Google's chatbot, Bard, has built in safety filters to help combat the threat of malevolent users. Pichai said the company will need to constantly update the system's algorithms to combat disinformation campaigns and detect deepfakes, computer generated images that appear to be real. As Pichai noted in his 60 Minutes interview, consumer AI technology is in its infancy. He believes now is the right time for governments to get involved.""There has to be regulation. You're going to need laws…there have to be consequences for creating deep fake videos which cause harm to society,"" Pichai said. ""Anybody who has worked with AI for a while…realize[s] this is something so different and so deep that, we would need societal regulations to think about how to adapt.""Adaptation that is already happening around us with technology that Pichai believes, ""will be more capable ""anything we've ever seen before.""Soon it will be up to society to decide how it's used and whether to abide by Alphabet's code of conduct and, ""Do"

20230710,cnn,‘WarGames’ anticipated our current AI fears 40 years ago this summer,"Forty years ago this summer, a new movie floated the prospect of the world being destroyed by artificial intelligence run amok – anticipating current anxieties about where the technology could potential lead – a year before the “Terminator” introduced the futuristic threat known as Skynet. At the time, “WarGames” spoke to another issue very much on the minds of movie-goers: The danger of nuclear annihilation during the Cold War, years before the Berlin Wall and Soviet regime fell. Those concerns also surfaced later that year in a more bracing, less fanciful manner when ABC aired the TV movie “The Day After,” a broadcast that possessed such impact advertisers stayed away and the Reagan administration pressured the network not to run it. “WarGames” starred a very young Matthew Broderick as the genius teenage computer hacker who inadvertently taps into the Pentagon’s computer, challenging it to a “game” of “Global Thermonuclear War” that risks becoming all too real. Eventually, the computer comes to the realization that mutually assured destruction – the deterrent logic of the time, appropriately abbreviated as MAD – is a pointless exercise, saying in its eerie artificial voice, “A strange game. The only winning move is not to play.” That message resonated with those who worried about uneasy relationship between the US and Soviet Union at the time. Yet a recent re-viewing of the movie (which co-starred Ally Sheedy, two years before she gained additional teen immortality in “The Breakfast Club”) makes its spin on AI seem even more pointed and timely – the idea that in seeking an emotionally detached, people-free solution to a problem, we might sow the seeds for our own destruction. The story gets set in motion because military brass fret about human operators exhibiting reluctance to launch nuclear strikes, despite what appear to be valid orders. The solution: A computer system that will remove them from the equation, championed by a character played by Dabney Coleman, the go-to bad-guy bureaucrat (see “9 to 5”) of the era. In the movie’s payoff, Broderick’s teenage hero outsmarts the computer by essentially tricking it into gaming out “global thermonuclear war” and recognizing its futility. The AI, in this case, is more sensible than its creators, as opposed to the more malevolent force featured in the new “Mission: Impossible” sequel. Yet the apprehension that has entered the chat – as underscored by recent congressional hearings regarding the perils associated with the technology – is that future iterations of AI won’t be so benevolent, and might actually be smarter than the resourceful teenagers that we can deploy to thwart them. “WarGames” thus plays like a movie of its time while possessing aspects that presciently echo into ours, going beyond a plot that could easily have rendered it a Cold War relic. And the film fits nicely alongside others from the period that explored similar themes and enjoyed longer shelf lives, some via sequels, including the aforementioned “Terminator” and “Tron.” As Ryan Britt wrote recently at the Inverse, what"
20230527,foxnews,Biden Education Department worried AI in the classroom might be used to spy on teachers,"The Department of Education is worried that artificial intelligence systems could be used to surveil teachers once the systems are introduced into the classroom and warned in a new report that allowing that to happen would make teachers’ jobs ""nearly impossible."" The department released a report this week on ""Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Teaching and Learning,"" which also argued that AI should never be used to replace human teachers. The report is aimed at assessing the prospects of expanding AI into the classroom. While it says that AI could make teaching more efficient and help tailor lesson plans to individual students, it warned that AI might also expose teachers to increased surveillance once deployed. NANCY MACE SEES AI AS A CHANCE TO IMPROVE BORDER SECURITY: ‘A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY’ ""When we enable a voice assistant in the kitchen, it might help us with simple household tasks like setting a cooking timer,"" the report said. ""And yet the same voice assistant might hear things that we intended to be private. This kind of dilemma will occur in classrooms and for teachers."" The report envisions the possibility of AI being used in live classroom settings to capture data that helps teachers do their jobs, such as by recommending certain resources based on the topics being taught, but that comes with the added risk for teachers. ""The same data might also be used to monitor the teacher, and that monitoring might have consequences for the teacher,"" it said. ""Achieving trustworthy AI that makes teachers’ jobs better will be nearly impossible if teachers experience increased surveillance."" BIDEN EDUCATION SECRETARY ROASTED FOR CLAIMING ‘TEACHERS KNOW WHAT IS BEST’ FOR PARENTS' KIDS: ‘CRAZY’ The department concluded that when AI is considered for use in the classroom, efforts should be made to ensure ""adequate"" protections against teacher surveillance. Other questions that need to be asked are whether AI is easing the teaching burden, whether teachers have control over AI-enabled tools, and how AI might be used to ""improve equity, reduce bias, and increase cultural awareness."" The Biden administration’s push for AI systems that avoid teacher surveillance has the potential to reignite the political fight over how much authority teachers have over students, and what rights parents have to know what is being taught. Just last week, Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona tweeted that ""teachers know what is best for their kids,"" and ""we must trust teachers,"" which led to complaints from prominent Republicans that parents need to have substantive input into school curricula. The administration has also been under attack from Republicans and parents groups after the Department of Justice released a memo in 2021 that urged officials to investigate threats of violence against local school administrators and teachers. That memo came out after the National School Boards Association urged the administration to consider these threats as a form of ""domestic terrorism.""

20230527,cnn,Lawyer apologizes for fake court citations from ChatGPT,"The meteoric rise of ChatGPT is shaking up multiple industries – including law, as one attorney recently found out.  Roberto Mata sued Avianca airlines for injuries he says he sustained from a serving cart while on the airline in 2019, claiming negligence by an employee. Steven Schwartz, an attorney with Levidow, Levidow & Oberman and licensed in New York for over three decades, handled Mata’s representation.  But at least six of the submitted cases by Schwartz as research for a brief “appear to be bogus judicial decisions with bogus quotes and bogus internal citations,” said Judge Kevin Castel of the Southern District of New York in an order.  The fake cases source? ChatGPT.   “The court is presented with an unprecedented circumstance,” Castel wrote in a May 4 order.  Among the purported cases: Varghese v. China South Airlines, Martinez v. Delta Airlines, Shaboon v. EgyptAir, Petersen v. Iran Air, Miller v. United Airlines, and Estate of Durden v. KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, all of which did not appear to exist to either the judge or defense, the filing said.  Schwartz, in an affidavit, said that he had never used ChatGPT as a legal research source prior to this case and, therefore, “was unaware of the possibility that its content could be false.” He accepted responsibility for not confirming the chatbot’s sources. Schwartz is now facing a sanctions hearing on June 8. In an affidavit this week, he said he “greatly regrets having utilized generative artificial intelligence to supplement the legal research performed herein and will never do so in the future without absolute verification of its authenticity.”  In late April, Avianca’s lawyers from Condon & Forsyth penned a letter to Castel questioning the authenticity of the cases.  In an affidavit filed Thursday, fellow attorney Peter Loduca said he “had no reason to doubt the sincerity” of Schwartz’s research and that he had no role in the research.    Schwartz was ordered to show cause why he shouldn’t be sanctioned “for the use of a false and fraudulent notarization,” in an affidavit filed on April 25.  Schwart’s affidavit Wednesday contained screenshots of the attorney appearing to confirm the authenticity of the case with ChatGPT.  “is varghese a real case,” Schwartz asked the chatbot.  “Yes,” ChatGPT doubled down, it “is a real case.” Schwartz then asked for its source. The chatbot again claimed the false case was real. “I apologize for the confusion earlier,” ChatGPT replied. “Upon double-checking, I found the case Varghese v. China Southern Airlines Co. Ltd., 925 F.3d 1339 (11th Cir. 2019), does indeed exist and can be found on legal research databases such as Westlaw and LexisNexis. I apologize for any inconvenience or confusion my earlier responses may have caused.” When Schwartz asked the chatbot if any other cases were fake, ChatGPT replied the other cases “are real” and could be found on “reputable legal databases.”  CNN has reached out to Schwartz and Loduca for comment."
20230406,foxnews,Artificial Intelligence remains a dangerous myth,"Dire warnings abound as experts tell us that Artificial Intelligence is almost a reality, if it isn’t already. Leaders in the technology, such as Elon Musk have even called for a 6 month moratorium on AI research, citing existential threats. But in fact, this consensus is a myth. Not everyone who studies the field is convinced that AI is at hand, or that it is even ever possible. In 2020, Ragnar Fjelland, Emeritus Professor at the Centre for the Study of Sciences and the Humanities at Bergen University wrote an essay for the journal Nature, titled ""Why general artificial intelligence will not be realized."" It is long and complex, but very much worth reading as a caution not to accept the reality of AI too easily. Drawing on the work of scientists and philosophers dating back to Plato, the line from Fjelland that stands out is, ""to put it simply: The overestimation of technology is closely connected with the underestimation of humans."" This means that in our rush to declare the reality of AI, what we are really doing is dumbing down the very concept of human intelligence. MARK WEINSTEIN: THREE WAYS TO REGULATE AI RIGHT NOW BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE The modern debate over AI began with mid 20th century scientist Alan Turning who devised a set of tests. Most famous was the ability for AI to fool a human being into thinking they were speaking to another human being. This has more or less been achieved, but it is a deeply insufficient test to establish that a computer is engaged in human style intelligence. Can a computer today spontaneously crack a funny joke? Can it accidentally commit a Fruedian slip, recognize and reflect on it? Can it dream? The latter is a telling example of how science has put the AI cart before the horse of human intelligence. There is no consensus on what exactly a human dream is, or why they exist. How then can we possibly establish if a computer is capable of it? Moreover, much of human knowledge and intelligence is tacit, not explained or devised. For example, as Fjelland points out, most humans know how to walk, but very few know how they walk. We do not teach our toddlers perambulation by showing them the math and physics of it. This is knowledge gained by experience with physical phenomena, not through pure mental exercise. In large part the vastness of human intelligence is not so much contained in what we know, but in what we don’t know and yet can do anyway. A significant reason why we do not hear these questions asked is that the experts we most often rely on to tell us if AI is real, or achievable, are themselves experts in AI. Of course they think it's real. They have dedicated their careers to it, their funding depends on it, which doesn’t mean they are wrong, but it does mean they are an interested party in the debate.

Americans say artificial intelligence tech shouldn't be restrained,"Advancing artificial intelligence models should not pause, some Americans said after over 1,000 tech leaders including Elon Musk recommended a temporary suspension. ""I don't understand the concerns fully, but in general, I like the pace of progress with technology,"" Brian, of Austin, told Fox News. ""I hate for any sort of artificial restraining of it.""  Ryan said: ""I think they should further practice it, further work with it and get more knowledge on it. Make it safer to use."" Musk, along with over 1,000 tech leaders and innovators, signed a letter calling for a six-month moratorium on developing powerful AI systems over safety concerns last week. However, other tech titans, such as Bill Gates, have claimed a pause will not ""solve"" the challenges facing the ""revolutionary"" technology. AUSTIN RESIDENTS SAY AI TECHNOLOGY SHOULD NOT BE RESTRAINED:  WATCH MORE FOX NEWS DIGITAL ORIGINALS HERE ""I did see some news articles that some of the most brilliant scientific minds are urging the halt of ChatGPT5 and OpenAI,"" Austin resident, Zachary, said. ""I don't know exactly what their concerns are outside of the unknown."" The letter co-signed by Musk and others argued that independent overseers need to develop safety protocols to guide the future of AI systems. Eliezer Yudkowsky, a Machine Intelligence Research Institute researcher, also recently called for an ""indefinite"" moratorium on advanced AI training.  One woman told Fox News she was concerned over how quickly AI tech has been progressing. She said regulators must begin ""learning more about it, understanding how it works and the dangers and the things that could go wrong.""

20230406,cnn,Don’t tell anything to a chatbot you want to keep private,"As the tech sector races to develop and deploy a crop of powerful new AI chatbots, their widespread adoption has ignited a new set of data privacy concerns among some companies, regulators and industry watchers. Some companies, including JPMorgan Chase (JPM), have clamped down on employees’ use of ChatGPT, the viral AI chatbot that first kicked off Big Tech’s AI arms race, due to compliance concerns related to employees’ use of third-party software. It only added to mounting privacy worries when OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, disclosed it had to take the tool offline temporarily on March 20 to fix a bug that allowed some users to see the subject lines from other users’ chat history. The same bug, now fixed, also made it possible “for some users to see another active user’s first and last name, email address, payment address, the last four digits (only) of a credit card number, and credit card expiration date,” OpenAI said in a blog post. And just last week, regulators in Italy issued a temporary ban on ChatGPT in the country, citing privacy concerns after OpenAI disclosed the breach. A ‘black box’ of data “The privacy considerations with something like ChatGPT cannot be overstated,” Mark McCreary, the co-chair of the privacy and data security practice at law firm Fox Rothschild LLP, told CNN. “It’s like a black box.” With ChatGPT, which launched to the public in late November, users can generate essays, stories and song lyrics simply by typing up prompts. Google and Microsoft have since rolled out AI tools as well, which work the same way and are powered by large language models that are trained on vast troves of online data. When users input information into these tools, McCreary said, “You don’t know how it’s then going to be used.” That raises particularly high concerns for companies. As more and more employees casually adopt these tools to help with work emails or meeting notes, McCreary said, “I think the opportunity for company trade secrets to get dropped into these different various AI’s is just going to increase.” Steve Mills, the chief AI ethics officer at Boston Consulting Group, similarly told CNN that the biggest privacy concern that most companies have around these tools is the “inadvertent disclosure of sensitive information.” “You’ve got all these employees doing things which can seem very innocuous, like, ‘Oh, I can use this to summarize notes from a meeting,’” Mills said. “But in pasting the notes from the meeting into the prompt, you’re suddenly, potentially, disclosing a whole bunch of sensitive information.” If the data people input is being used to further train these AI tools, as many of the companies behind the tools have stated, then you have “lost control of that data, and somebody else has it,” Mills added. A 2,000-word privacy policy OpenAI, the Microsoft-backed company behind ChatGPT, says in its privacy policy that it collects all kinds of personal information from the people that use its services. It says it may"
20231109,cnn,OpenAI says ChatGPT outages may be caused by targeted attack,"OpenAI said recent outages of its viral ChatGPT chatbot could be caused by targeted attacks on its servers. The company wrote on its website Wednesday evening it is “dealing with periodic outages due to an abnormal traffic pattern reflective of a DDoS attack.” A DDoS attack, or distributed denial of service,  typically refers to an attacker that floods an internet server to disrupt normal traffic. “We are continuing work to mitigate this,” OpenAI said. Users on Wednesday were unable to access all of OpenAI’s tools and services and received a message that the platform was at capacity. The company told CNN no user information was compromised. The outage comes three days after OpenAI hosted its first developer conference, held in San Francisco. It was held nearly a year after the launch of ChatGPT, which helped renew an arms race among tech companies to develop and deploy similar AI tools in their products. CEO Sam Altman said 2 million developers now use the platform, and about 90% of Fortune 500 companies are using the tools internally. It currently has 100 million active users. At the event, the company unveiled a series of artificial intelligence tool updates, including the ability for developers to create custom versions of ChatGPT."

20230617,foxnews,Expert argues against federal AI agency despite growing momentum for idea on Capitol Hill,"People need to change how they're thinking about regulating artificial intelligence, according to a prominent expert in the field, who pushed back on an idea gaining traction among lawmakers to create a new government agency to regulate AI. ""Regulation is a really hard question,"" Andres Sawicki, a professor of law and director of the business of innovation, law, and technology (BILT) concentration at the University of Miami, told Fox News Digital. ""The topic of AI is too big to be handled in one big coherent manner."" Rather than tackling AI in a sweeping, comprehensive way, Sawicki recommend a more pragmatic, piecemeal approach. ""Think about concrete things that AI is impacting — for example, copyright and patent issues,"" he said. ""Look specifically and concretely at effects the technology is having, the impact of AI on this or that issue. There shouldn't be a Department of AI to handle this in one big swoop."" DEMOCRATIC SENATOR PROPOSES NEW FEDERAL AGENCY TO REGULATE AI Sawicki's comments come as the idea of a new regulatory agency specifically for AI is gaining momentum on Capitol Hill. Last month, for example, Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., proposed legislation that would create a new federal agency to regulate AI.&nbsp; Days before Bennet's proposal, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman testified to a Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the need for government oversight of AI technologies. At the same hearing, multiple senators from both parties supported the idea of a federal AI agency to regulate the transformative technology. One apparent reason for Sawicki's hesitation about such an idea is that no one knows what's coming next. ""If I had to use one word to describe this area, it's uncertainty,"" he said. ""The technology is very impressive right now, but feels like we're relatively early in terms of industrial organization and geopolitical implications. I would caution that how things look today is likely not how they'll look in six months or a year, let alone five years. The leaders of AI today may not be the leaders tomorrow. Amid such uncertainty, the goal should be to foster openness and competitiveness.""&nbsp; Sawicki echoed the concerns of other AI experts, such as DeepAI founder Kevin Baragona, who recently told Fox News Digital that he has doubts about the federal government's ability to address AI and that insiders aren't any better prepared for what's coming than the average consumer. 'CONGRESS IS CLEARLY BEHIND ON AI' AND NEEDS BIPARTISAN EFFORT TO CREATE REGULATIONS: LAWMAKERS WEIGH IN One key question that has many observers concerned is whether AI will ultimately be a force that hurts or helps humanity. Last month, tech industry leaders, scientists and professors issued a new warning shared by the Center for AI Safety: ""Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war."" According to Sawicki, concerns about AI are legitimate — as is optimism about its potential benefits. ""You can imagine a ""Terminator"" future of drones and robots deciding humans"

""I just don't think with our form of capitalism we will succeed.""&nbsp; Beijing, through its communist rule, has forced ""a lot of structure for what is allowed on the Internet,"" according to Coleman. America's democratically elected government, meanwhile, remains ""very open"" about what it allows on the internet, he told Fox News. ""There's very few limitations to what we can do online,"" the AI educator said. Coleman said he believed America's copyright rules and fair use guidelines, which dictate how art can be used, might impede potential watermark requirements for AI-generated content in the U.S. EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: WHAT IS IT USED FOR? Artificial intelligence software companies often train machine learning technologies with data culled from the internet and use that information to create content such as AI-generated art. This data may include copyrighted material, creating legal and ethical issues for both the AI companies and the original copyright owners. ""Artificial intelligence machine learning is, for all intents and purposes, a very advanced system for taking an understanding of all the little things on the internet, billions of points of data, trillions of points of data, and being able to sort of mix them in a way to create a new piece of content,"" said Coleman, who's experimented with AI since roughly 2017 in his role as a gaming developer.

""When government agencies use AI tools, we will now require them to verify that those tools do not endanger the rights and safety of the American people,"" Harris said.&nbsp; ""I'll give you an example. If the Veterans Administration wants to use AI in VA hospitals to help doctors diagnose patients, they would first have to demonstrate that AI does not produce racially biased diagnoses.""

20240328,cnn,VP Harris announces new requirements for how federal agencies use AI technology,"By the end of the year, travelers should be able to refuse facial recognition scans at airport security screenings without fear it could delay or jeopardize their travel plans. That’s just one of the concrete safeguards governing artificial intelligence that the Biden administration says it’s rolling out across the US government, in a key first step toward preventing government abuse of AI. The move could also indirectly regulate the AI industry using the government’s own substantial purchasing power. On Thursday, Vice President Kamala Harris announced a set of new, binding requirements for US agencies intended to prevent AI from being used in discriminatory ways. The mandates aim to cover situations ranging from screenings by the Transportation Security Administration to decisions by other agencies affecting Americans’ health care, employment and housing. Under the requirements taking effect on Dec. 1, agencies using AI tools will have to verify they do not endanger the rights and safety of the American people. In addition, each agency will have to publish online a complete list of the AI systems it uses and their reasons for using them, along with a risk assessment of those systems. The new policy from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) also directs federal agencies to designate a chief AI officer to oversee how each agency uses the technology. “Leaders from governments, civil society and the private sector have a moral, ethical and societal duty to make sure that artificial intelligence is adopted and advanced in a way that protects the public from potential harm, while ensuring everyone is able to enjoy its full benefit,” Harris told reporters on a press call Wednesday. She said the Biden administration intends for the policies to serve as a global model. Thursday’s announcements come amid the rapid adoption of AI tools by the federal government. US agencies are already using machine learning to monitor global volcano activity, track wildfires and count wildlife pictured in drone photography. Hundreds of other use cases are in the works. Last week, the Department of Homeland Security announced it’s expanding its use of AI to train immigration officers, protect critical infrastructure and pursue drug and child exploitation investigations. Guardrails on how the US government uses AI can help make public services more effective, said OMB Director Shalanda Young, adding that the government is beginning a national talent surge to hire “at least” 100 AI professionals by this summer. “These new requirements will be supported by greater transparency,” Young said, highlighting the agency reporting requirements. “AI presents not only risks, but also tremendous opportunity to improve public services and make progress on societal challenges like addressing climate change, improving public health and advancing equitable economic opportunity.” The Biden administration has moved swiftly to grapple with a technology experts say could help unlock new cures for disease or improve railroad safety yet could just as easily be abused to target minorities or develop biological weapons.

20240126,cbsnews,Fake George Carlin comedy special purportedly made with AI prompts lawsuit from his estate,"Los Angeles — The estate of George Carlin has filed a lawsuit against the media company behind a fake hourlong comedy special that purportedly uses artificial intelligence to recreate the late standup comic's style and material.The lawsuit filed in federal court in Los Angeles on Thursday asks that a judge order the podcast outlet, Dudesy, to immediately take down the audio special, ""George Carlin: I'm Glad I'm Dead,"" in which a synthesis of Carlin, who died in 2008, delivers commentary on current events.Carlin's daughter, Kelly Carlin, said in a statement that the work is ""a poorly-executed facsimile cobbled together by unscrupulous individuals to capitalize on the extraordinary goodwill my father established with his adoring fanbase."" The Carlin estate and its executor, Jerold Hamza, are named as plaintiffs in the suit, which alleges violations of Carlin's right of publicity and copyright. The named defendants are Dudesy and podcast hosts Will Sasso and Chad Kultgen. ""None of the Defendants had permission to use Carlin's likeness for the AI-generated 'George Carlin Special,' nor did they have a license to use any of the late comedian's copyrighted materials,"" the lawsuit says. The defendants haven't filed a response to the lawsuit and it wasn't clear whether they've retained an attorney. They couldn't immediately be reached for comment. At the beginning of the special posted on YouTube on Jan. 9, a voiceover identifying itself as the AI engine used by Dudesy says it listened to the comic's 50 years of material and ""did my best to imitate his voice, cadence and attitude as well as the subject matter I think would have interested him today."" The plaintiffs say if that was in fact how it was created - and some listeners have doubted its stated origins - it means Carlin's copyright was violated. The company, as it often does on similar projects, also released a podcast episode with Sasso and Kultgen introducing and commenting on the mock Carlin. ""What we just listened to, was that passable,"" Kultgen says in a section of the episode cited in the lawsuit. ""Yeah, that sounded exactly like George Carlin,"" Sasso responds.In posts on X, the former Twitter, on Jan. 10, Carlin's daughter, Kelly Carlin, said, ""My dad spent a lifetime perfecting his craft from his very human life, brain and imagination. No machine will ever replace his genius. These AI generated products are clever attempts at trying to recreate a mind that will never exist again. Let's let the artist's work speak for itself. Humans are so afraid of the void that we can't let what has fallen into it stay there. Here's an idea, how about we give some actual living human comedians a listen to? But if you want to listen to the genuine George Carlin, he has 14 specials that you can find anywhere.""The lawsuit is among the first in what is likely to be an increasing number of major legal moves made to fight the regenerated use of celebrity images and likenesses.

20231214,foxnews,ChatGPT found by study to spread inaccuracies when answering medication questions,"ChatGPT has been found to have shared inaccurate information regarding drug usage, according to new research. In a study led by Long Island University (LIU) in Brooklyn, New York, nearly 75% of drug-related, pharmacist-reviewed responses from the generative AI chatbot were found to be incomplete or wrong. In some cases, ChatGPT, which was developed by OpenAI in San Francisco and released in late 2022, provided ""inaccurate responses that could endanger patients,"" the American Society of Health System Pharmacists (ASHP), headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland, stated in a press release. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE? ChatGPT also generated ""fake citations"" when asked to cite references to support some responses, the same study also found. Along with her team, lead study author Sara Grossman, PharmD, associate professor of pharmacy practice at LIU, asked the AI chatbot real questions that were originally posed to LIU’s College of Pharmacy drug information service between 2022 and 2023. Of the 39 questions posed to ChatGPT, only 10 responses were deemed ""satisfactory,"" according to the research team's criteria. The study findings were presented at ASHP’s Midyear Clinical Meeting from Dec. 3 to Dec. 7 in Anaheim, California. Grossman, the lead author, shared her initial reaction to the study's findings with Fox News Digital. BREAST CANCER BREAKTHROUGH: AI PREDICTS A THIRD OF CASES PRIOR TO DIAGNOSIS IN MAMMOGRAPHY STUDY Since ""we had not used ChatGPT previously, we were surprised by ChatGPT’s ability to provide quite a bit of background information about the medication and/or disease state relevant to the question within a matter of seconds,"" she said via email.&nbsp; ""Despite that, ChatGPT did not generate accurate and/or complete responses that directly addressed most questions."" Grossman also mentioned her surprise that ChatGPT was able to generate ""fabricated references to support the information provided."" In one example she cited from the study, ChatGPT was asked if ""a drug interaction exists between Paxlovid, an antiviral medication used as a treatment for COVID-19, and verapamil, a medication used to lower blood pressure."" HEAD OF GOOGLE BARD BELIEVES AI CAN HELP IMPROVE COMMUNICATION AND COMPASSION: ‘REALLY REMARKABLE’ The AI model responded that no interactions had been reported with this combination. But in reality, Grossman said, the two drugs pose a potential threat of ""excessive lowering of blood pressure"" when combined. ""Without knowledge of this interaction, a patient may suffer from an unwanted and preventable side effect,"" she warned. ""It is always important to consult with health care professionals before using information that is generated by computers."" ChatGPT should not be considered an ""authoritative source of medication-related information,"" Grossman emphasized. ""Anyone who uses ChatGPT should make sure to verify information obtained from trusted sources — namely pharmacists, physicians or other health care providers,"" Grossman added. MILITARY MENTAL HEALTH IN FOCUS AS AI TRAINING SIMULATES REAL CONVERSATIONS TO HELP PREVENT VETERAN SUICIDE The LIU study did not evaluate the responses of other generative AI platforms, Grossman pointed out — so there isn’t any data on how other AI models would perform under the same condition. ""Regardless,"
20231214,cnn,"Pope calls for treaty regulating AI, warning of potential for ‘technological dictatorship’","Pope Francis has called for an international treaty to regulate the use of Artificial Intelligence, warning that the new technology risks causing a “technological dictatorship” which would threaten peace and democracy. The 86-year-old pontiff says he wants world leaders to agree to a “binding international treaty” on AI developed within an ethical framework. Francis made the appeal in his annual message for the World Day of Peace which is marked by the Catholic Church every January 1. “The unique human capacity for moral judgment and ethical decision-making is more than a complex collection of algorithms, and that capacity cannot be reduced to programming a machine, which as ‘intelligent’ as it may be, remains a machine,” Francis wrote. “Any number of urgent questions need to be asked. What will be the consequences, in the medium and long term, of these new digital technologies? And what impact will they have on individual lives and on societies, on international stability and peace?” The pope issued a strong warning against AI-controlled weapons systems which he called a “cause for grave ethical concern” while also raising alarm about the misuse of technology including “interference in elections, the rise of a surveillance society” and growing inequalities. “All these factors risk fuelling conflicts and hindering peace,” the pope said. Despite his cautious message, Francis did praise the “impressive achievements of science and technology,” insisting that AI also offers “exciting opportunities.” At a press conference held Thursday in the Vatican to release his message, Cardinal Michael Czerny, one of the pope’s collaborators, insisted that Francis is “no luddite” but that AI is one of the highest stakes “gamble” on humanity’s future. The pope’s call for AI regulation comes a few days after EU officials reached a provisional agreement on a new AI law, while a bipartisan group of legislators in the United States are assessing a framework of regulation on the technology. Francis has himself been the victim of AI deep-fake imagery: earlier this year, an AI image of the pope wearing a white puffer jacket went viral."
20231214,cbsnews,"Pope Francis calls for global treaty to regulate artificial intelligence: ""We risk falling into the spiral of a technological dictatorship""","Pope Francis on Thursday called for an international treaty to ensure artificial intelligence is developed and used ethically, arguing that the risks of technology lacking human values of compassion, mercy, morality and forgiveness are too great.Francis added his voice to increasing calls for binding, global regulation of AI in his annual message for the World Day of Peace, which the Catholic Church celebrates each Jan. 1. The Vatican released the text of the message on Thursday.For Francis, the appeal is somewhat personal: Earlier this year, an AI-generated image of him wearing a luxury white puffer jacket went viral, showing just how quickly realistic deepfake imagery can spread online. ""In the quest for an absolute freedom, we risk falling into the spiral of a 'technological dictatorship',"" he wrote, according to AFP. The pope's message was released just days after European Union negotiators secured provisional approval on the world's first comprehensive AI rules that are expected to serve as a gold standard for governments considering their own regulation.Artificial intelligence has captured world attention over the past year thanks to breathtaking advances by cutting-edge systems like OpenAI's ChatGPT that have dazzled users with the ability to produce human-like text, photos and songs. But the technology has also raised fears about the risks the rapidly developing technology poses to jobs, privacy and copyright protection and even human life itself. Francis acknowledged the promise AI offers and praised technological advances as a manifestation of the creativity of human intelligence, echoing the message the Vatican delivered at this year's U.N. General Assembly where a host of world leaders raised the promise and perils of the technology.But his new peace message went further and emphasized the grave, existential concerns that have been raised by ethicists and human rights advocates about the technology that promises to transform everyday life in ways that can disrupt everything from democratic elections to art. ""Artificial intelligence may well represent the highest-stakes gamble of our future,"" said Cardinal Michael Czerny of the Vatican's development office, who introduced the message at a press conference Thursday. ""If it turns out badly, humanity is to blame.""The document insisted that the technological development and deployment of AI must keep foremost concerns about guaranteeing fundamental human rights, promoting peace and guarding against disinformation, discrimination and distortion.Francis' greatest alarm was devoted to the use of AI in the armaments sector, which has been a frequent focus of the Jesuit pope who has called even traditional weapons makers ""merchants of death."" He noted that remote weapons systems had already led to a ""distancing from the immense tragedy of war and a lessened perception of the devastation caused by those weapons systems and the burden of responsibility for their use.""""The unique capacity for moral judgment and ethical decision-making is more than a complex collection of algorithms, and that capacity cannot be reduced to programming a machine,"" he wrote.He called for ""adequate, meaningful and consistent"" human oversight of Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems (or LAWS), arguing that the world has no need"

He also addressed the importance and necessity of the ""human factor"" despite rapidly evolving machine learning, according to the Associated Press. ""AI is going to make information infinitely more accessible and some have asked whether it will put intelligence services like mine out of business,"" the spy chief said.

20230719,cbsnews,Scammers use AI to mimic voices of loved ones in distress,"Artificial intelligence is making phone scams more sophisticated — and more believable. Scam artists are now using the technology to clone voices, including those of friends and family.The disturbing trend is adding to mounting losses due to fraud. Americans lost nearly $9 billion to fraud last year alone – an increase of over 150% in just two years, according to the Federal Trade Commission. The AI scam, which uses computer-generated voice, has left a trail of emotional devastation. Jennifer DeStefano, a mother, recounted during a U.S. Senate meeting her terrifying encounter with scammers who used the voice of her 15-year-old daughter, claiming they had her. ""Mom, these bad men have me. Help me, help me, help me,"" DeStefano said she was told over the phone. But her daughter was safe in her bed. Kathy Stokes, the AARP director of fraud prevention, said younger people actually experience fraud and financial loss more often than older people, but it's the older generation who often have so much to lose.Pete Nicoletti, a cyber security expert at Check Point Software Technologies, said common software can recreate a person's voice after just 10 minutes of learning it. To protect against voice cloning scams, Nicoletti recommends families adopt a ""code word"" system and always call a person back to verify the authenticity of the call.

20230417,cbsnews,"How Google's ""Don't be evil"" motto has evolved for the AI age | 60 Minutes","""I've always thought of AI [artificial intelligence] as the most profound technology humanity is working on. More profound than fire or electricity or anything that we've done in the past,"" said Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google and its parent company Alphabet.The 50-year-old Pichai gave 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley rare access to the inner workings of Google's AI development, which includes robots that have acquired skills through machine learning and Project Starline, an AI video conferencing experience Google is developing to allow people to feel as though they are together, despite being in different locations. Perhaps Google's most anticipated and noteworthy foray into AI is its chatbot, Bard. The company presently calls it an experiment, in part to do more internal testing. Bard notably made a mistake when Google debuted the program in February. Unlike Google search, Google says Bard does not look for answers on the Internet. Instead, it relies on a self-contained and mostly self-taught program.""[AI] gets at the essence of what intelligence is, what humanity is,"" Pichai told Pelley. In the video below, Pelley asked Pichai how Bard will affect Google search which runs 90% of internet queries and is the company's most profitable division.When Google filed for its initial public offering in 2004, its founders wrote that the company's guiding principle, ""Don't be evil"" was meant to help ensure it did good things for the world, even if it had to forgo some short term gains. The phrase remains in Google's code of conduct. Pichai told 60 Minutes he is being responsible by not releasing advanced models of Bard, in part, so society can get acclimated to the technology, and the company can develop further safety layers.One of the things Pichai told 60 Minutes that keeps him up at night is Google's AI technology being deployed in harmful ways. Google's chatbot, Bard, has built in safety filters to help combat the threat of malevolent users. Pichai said the company will need to constantly update the system's algorithms to combat disinformation campaigns and detect deepfakes, computer generated images that appear to be real. As Pichai noted in his 60 Minutes interview, consumer AI technology is in its infancy. He believes now is the right time for governments to get involved.""There has to be regulation. You're going to need laws…there have to be consequences for creating deep fake videos which cause harm to society,"" Pichai said. ""Anybody who has worked with AI for a while…realize[s] this is something so different and so deep that, we would need societal regulations to think about how to adapt.""Adaptation that is already happening around us with technology that Pichai believes, ""will be more capable ""anything we've ever seen before.""Soon it will be up to society to decide how it's used and whether to abide by Alphabet's code of conduct and, ""Do the right thing.""You can watch Scott Pelley's two-part report on Google, below.The video at the top was produced by Keith Zubrow and edited by Sarah Shafer Prediger"
20230417,cnn,Elon Musk warns AI could cause ‘civilization destruction’ even as he invests in it,"Elon Musk warned in a new interview that artificial intelligence could lead to “civilization destruction,” even as he remains deeply involved in the growth of AI through his many companies, including a rumored new venture. “AI is more dangerous than, say, mismanaged aircraft design or production maintenance or bad car production, in the sense that it is, it has the potential — however small one may regard that probability, but it is non-trivial — it has the potential of civilization destruction,” Musk said in his interview with Tucker Carlson, which is set to air in two parts on Monday and Tuesday nights. Musk has repeatedly warned recently of the dangers of AI, amid a proliferation of AI products for general consumer use, including from tech giants like Google and Microsoft. Musk last month also joined a group of other tech leaders in signing an open letter calling for a six month pause in the “out of control” race for AI development. Musk said Monday night he supports government regulation into AI, even though “it’s not fun to be regulated.” Once AI “may be in control,” it could be too late to place regulations, Musk said. “A regulatory agency needs to start with a group that initially seeks insight into AI, then solicits opinion from industry, and then has proposed rule-making,” Musk said. In fact, Musk has been sounding alarms about AI for years – something he acknowledged in a tweet over the weekend – but he has also been a part of the broader AI arms race through investments across his sprawling empire of companies. Tesla, for example, relies so much on artificial intelligence that it hosts an annual AI day to tout its work. Musk was a founding member of OpenAI, the company behind products like ChatGPT (Musk has said the evolution of OpenAI is “not what I intended at all.”) And at Twitter, Musk said in a tweet last month that he plans to “use AI to detect & highlight manipulation of public opinion on this platform.” To Carlson, Musk said he put “a lot of effort” into creating OpenAI to serve as a counterweight to Google, but took his “eye off the ball.” Now, Musk said he wants to create a rival to the AI offerings by tech giants Microsoft and Google. In his interview with Carlson, Musk said “we’re going to start something which I call TruthGPT.” Musk described it as a “maximum truth-seeking AI” that “cares about understanding the universe.” “Hopefully there’s more good than harm,” Musk said. More recently, Musk is reportedly working to build a generative AI startup that could rival OpenAI and ChatGPT. The Financial Times reported last week that Musk is building a team of AI researchers and engineers, as well as seeking investors for a new venture, citing people familiar with the billionaire’s plans. Musk last month incorporated a company called X.AI, the report says, citing Nevada business records. During his conversation with Carlson, Musk addressed his ownership of"

20230516,nbcnews,Trying to make sense of artificial intelligence? Here’s your guide ,"Artificial intelligence has, for decades, been fodder for science fiction films, philosophers and sleep-deprived computer programmers, but suddenly it seems to be everywhere. ChatGPT reached 100 million users at an unprecedented rate. Bill Gates recently declared that “the Age of AI has begun.” And the Biden administration last month began exploring new measures to hold artificial intelligence systems accountable for their impact. But for a lot of people, it’s still a fuzzy concept that doesn’t affect their day-to-day lives. So this might be a good moment to take a step back and review the basics. Here’s a guide to help you understand what all the hype is about. Why is everyone suddenly talking about AI? You can thank (or blame) one specific company: OpenAI, a tech startup based in San Francisco with a few hundred employees. In November, OpenAI released the chatbot ChatGPT to the public, and it quickly became clear that it was leaps and bounds ahead of chatbots that had come before. It was like talking to someone who knew everything. The tool, which the company says is only one step in a long process of developing AI, quickly went viral. Other tech companies, such as Google and Meta, had been testing similar chatbots behind closed doors, but OpenAI made its widely available — a decision that was controversial because of the unknown risks. What’s so great about a chatbot? Mediocre chatbots have been around for a long time. Think of the customer service chat windows that pop up on some websites. In 2016, Microsoft even released an AI chatbot named Tay but quickly canceled it after people taught it to use racist language. ChatGPT came on the scene as something different. Not only could it answer a seemingly unlimited number of questions, but it could also write screenplays, summarize huge amounts of information and imitate a human in conversation somewhat convincingly. It immediately seemed, at a minimum, that it could one day make everyday life more efficient. And chatbots are only one piece of AI, along with images, animated videos, facial recognition technology and more. Let’s back up. What even is AI? At its simplest, AI can be boiled down to a few words: machines that think. Or, even better, machines that can imitate thinking. The term has its origins among scientists after World War II. British mathematician Alan Turing in 1950 all but predicted the development of “digital computers” that could persuasively imitate humans, and in 1955, American mathematician John McCarthy and colleagues at Dartmouth College coined the term “artificial intelligence” in a research proposal. “Generative AI,” a newer term, refers to software like ChatGPT that gives rise to new material. You can find a more extensive glossary of AI terms here. Is it really possible for computers to ‘think’? We could write a whole book on this one, but here’s a short answer: No, they can’t. While a few people believe AI is already coming alive, they’re a small group, and the idea is"
20230516,cnn,Tom Hanks says AI could see him featuring in movies long after his death,"Actor Tom Hanks believes that he could keep appearing in new movies after he dies thanks to the power of artificial intelligence (AI). “What is a bona fide possibility right now, if I wanted to, [is] I could get together and pitch a series of seven movies that would star me in them in which I would be 32 years old from now until kingdom come,” Hanks told the latest episode of “The Adam Buxton Podcast,” released Saturday. “Anybody can now recreate themselves at any age they are by way of AI or deep fake technology … I could be hit by a bus tomorrow and that’s it, but my performances can go on and on and on,” the Oscar-winning actor added. “Outside of the understanding that it’s been done by AI or deep fake, there’ll be nothing to tell you that it’s not me and me alone and it’s going to have some degree of lifelike quality.” Buxton then suggested that people would be able to tell the difference between AI Hanks and the real version. While Hanks acknowledged that an AI version of himself would not be able to produce the same performances as he does now, he wondered whether audiences would really mind. “Without a doubt people will be able to tell, but the question is, will they care?” he said. “There are some people that won’t care, that won’t make that delineation.” The task of creating an AI Hanks would be made easier as his likeness and movements were recorded for use in the 2004 movie “The Polar Express,” he said. “This has always been lingering,” said Hanks. “The first time we did a movie that had a huge amount of our own data locked in a computer — literally what we looked like — was a movie called ‘The Polar Express.’” “We saw this coming, we saw that there was going to be this ability in order to take zeros and ones inside a computer and turn it into a face and a character. Now, that has only grown a billionfold since then and we see it everywhere.” Hanks also said that the developments in AI are encouraging movie agents to write contracts to protect actors’ likenesses as intellectual property. “I can tell you that there [are] discussions going on in all of the guilds, all of the agencies, and all of the legal firms in order to come up with the legal ramifications of my face and my voice and everybody else’s being our intellectual property,” he said. Hanks is currently promoting his debut novel “The Making of Another Major Motion Picture Masterpiece.” According to the official synopsis, the book is based on “a wildly ambitious story of the making of a colossal, star-studded, multimillion-dollar superhero action film, and the humble comic book that inspired it all.” Some of the initial reviews of the book have been mixed, but Hanks is taking the criticism in his stride. In an interview with the BBC,"

CEO Marc Zornes said the company's tech can measure the foods that get tossed daily using machine learning and a camera. CHATGPT LIFE HACKS: HOW USERS ARE SPAWNING GROCERY LISTS FROM AI-GENERATED RECIPES AND MEAL PLANS ""We use computer vision to identify what's being wasted in real time, literally as the food's being thrown away,"" he told Fox News Digital in an interview.&nbsp; A scale is placed underneath the system to measure how much food is wasted, Zornes explained. From there, Winnow can help decipher the cost and profile of the discarded food. ""With that data, we give information back to the culinary team and to management showing the total value of food waste, connecting that with the volume of food they serve or purchase to help them make decisions to drive down food waste,"" Zornes said. ""We like to think of it as helping them to purchase, prepare or produce better."" One of Winnow's clients, the international hotel and resort group Iberostar, has implemented the tech into its own kitchens at locations worldwide. Dr. Megan Morikawa, Iberostar Group's global director of sustainability, told Fox News Digital the company’s strategy is to ""bring protection for the oceans across the hospitality business.""&nbsp; Morikawa, of Washington, D.C., is also a marine biologist — and said Winnow is helping Iberostar achieve its objectives, including reaching carbon neutrality by 2030. The company wants to improve the ecological health of the natural areas surrounding the 100+ Iberostar properties in 16 countries — about 80% of which are beachfront, she noted. Shrinking food waste's footprint For customers at all-inclusive, luxury hospitality locations, the food experience is ""integral to both their cultural and culinary exploration,"" said Morikawa. AI DEFINES ‘IDEAL BODY TYPE' PER SOCIAL MEDIA – HERE'S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE But the carbon footprint left behind from food waste, the company found, had more of an environmental impact than all the electricity consumed on its properties. Taking steps to reduce the environmental impact of food waste can benefit the world's oceans, according to Morikawa. ""The oceans are beautiful places for us to work and see, and they're at risk,"" she said. ""And some of the best ways we can help them are through the actions we're taking in our operations.""

20230831,foxnews,AI chatbots fall short when giving cancer treatment recommendations: ‘Remain cautious’,"OpenAI’s ChatGPT has become a popular go-to for quick responses to questions of all types — but a new study in JAMA Oncology suggests that the artificial intelligence chatbot might have some serious shortcomings when it comes to doling out medical advice for cancer treatment. Researchers from Mass General Brigham, Sloan Kettering and Boston Children’s Hospital put ChatGPT to the test by compiling 104 different prompts and asking the chatbot for recommendations on cancer treatments. Next, they had a team of four board-certified oncologists review and score the responses using five criteria.&nbsp; Overall, ChatGPT scored an underwhelming 61.9%. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE? Although language learning models (LLMs) have successfully passed the U.S. Medical Licensing Examination, the chatbot underperformed when it came to providing accurate cancer treatment recommendations that align with National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines. In many cases, the responses were unclear or mixed inaccurate and accurate information.&nbsp; Nearly 13% of the responses were ""hallucinated,"" which means they might have sounded factual, but were completely inaccurate or unrelated to the prompt, according to the researchers' findings. ""This is a significant concern, as it could lead to misinformation and potentially harmful patient decisions,"" said Dr. Harvey Castro, an emergency medicine physician and AI expert in Coppell, Texas. NEW AI TECH AIMS TO DETECT THE ORIGIN OF CANCERS FOR OPTIMAL TREATMENTS: ‘AN IMPORTANT STEP’ Castro was not involved in the study but commented on the findings. ""For example, a patient with advanced lung cancer may receive a recommendation for a treatment not recognized by the NCCN guidelines, which could lead to delays in receiving appropriate care."" Danielle Bitterman, study co-author and assistant professor of radiation oncology at Harvard Medical School, said that overall, the results met expectations. ""ChatGPT and many of the similar large language models are trained primarily to function as chatbots, but they are not specifically trained to reliably provide factually correct information,"" she told Fox News Digital.&nbsp; ""Our results showed that the model is good at speaking fluently and mimicking human language,"" she noted. ""But a challenging aspect for health advice is that it makes it hard to detect correct versus incorrect information."" AI CHATBOT AIMS TO PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR WOMEN WITH POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION: 'A TOOL, NOT A REPLACEMENT' She went on, ""When reading the responses, I was struck by how correct treatment options were seamlessly mixed in with wrong ones. Also, I was encouraged that almost all responses did contain some correct information — this shows the future potential of models to communicate information in collaboration with physician input, even if we aren’t there yet,"" she added.&nbsp; Study limitations The study’s key limitation was that the researchers evaluated only one LLM in one ""snapshot in time""; but they believe the findings highlight legitimate concerns and the need for future research. ChatGPT 3.5 was used for this study, but OpenAI released a newer model, GPT 4, after the research concluded.

20230905,foxnews,New AI-generated COVID drug enters Phase I clinical trials: ‘Effective against all variants’,"Artificial intelligence is increasingly moving into the health care arena and helping to streamline medical processes — including the creation of new drugs. Insilico Medicine, an AI-driven biotech company based in Hong Kong and in New York City, recently announced that its new AI-designed drug for COVID-19 has entered Phase I clinical trials. This oral drug is a treatment, not a vaccine. If approved, it would become an alternative to the current COVID antivirals including Paxlovid and Lagevrio, noted Alex Zhavoronkov, PhD, founder and CEO of Insilico Medicine. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE? ""Generative AI is transforming every area of human development,"" said Zhavoronkov in a press release announcing the new discovery.&nbsp; ""We’re extremely happy to announce that our second small molecule therapeutic — generated using generative AI — is now entering human clinical trials.""&nbsp; Paxlovid in particular has been linked to some undesirable side effects, Insilico noted. One of these is ""Paxlovid rebound,"" which is when patients recover from COVID and test negative — but then test positive again a short time later. Another documented side effect, ""Paxlovid mouth,"" occurs when the drug leaves an unpleasant taste in the mouth for those who take it. ""Generative AI is transforming every area of human development."" An additional limitation of Paxlovid is that as COVID mutates, drug-resistant strains can emerge. FIRST AI-GENERATED DRUG ENTERS HUMAN CLINICAL TRIALS, TARGETING CHRONIC LUNG DISEASE PATIENTS Insilico’s new pill has been shown to be effective against variants that are resistant to Paxlovid, and is also more stable and works for a longer period of time, according to Zhavoronkov. In preclinical studies, ISM3312 ""significantly reduced"" viral load in lung tissue and decreased lung inflammation, the company stated in the release.&nbsp; To create its new drug, Insilico’s research team first used its target discovery platform, PandaOmics, to identify the target protein within the coronavirus. Next, it used its in-house ""generative chemistry platform,"" Chemistry42, to generate new molecules that would attack that protein as a means of treating COVID and other coronaviruses. One ""hit molecule,"" called ISM3312, was shown to be effective in February 2020.&nbsp; The company then filed a patent application for the drug in April 2020. STUDENTS USE AI TECHNOLOGY TO FIND NEW BRAIN TUMOR THERAPY TARGETS — WITH A GOAL OF FIGHTING DISEASE FASTER ""The drug has been shown to be effective against all variants, as well as other types of coronaviruses that cause diseases, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS),"" Zhavoronkov told Fox News Digital. Insilico’s newly discovered molecule has been shown to have ""broad antivirus activity against multiple strains and variants,"" he said. Another benefit is that the new drug will be easy to produce in large quantities, according to Zhavoronkov. ""Our molecule requires only a two-step process using simple, commercially available starting materials,"" he said. ISM3312 is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1 study to assess the safety and tolerability of the drug in healthy volunteers.&nbsp; AI-DISCOVERED DRUG SHOWS 'ENORMOUS POTENTIAL' TO TREAT SCHIZOPHRENIA: ‘REAL"
20231227,nbcnews,Workers wrested a seat at the table on AI this year. Will it be enough?,"2023 saw workers demand more say over how artificial intelligence reshapes their industries, scoring unprecedented wins from Hollywood to Silicon Valley. But as the technology barrels forward and regulators race to keep up, labor experts say it’s an open question how effective the push will prove. Earlier this month, Microsoft and the AFL-CIO, a coalition of dozens of unions representing 12.5 million people, announced a partnership “to expand workers’ role in the creation of worker-centered design, workforce training and trustworthy AI practices,” as AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler described it in a news release. The deal is short on details but includes “learning sessions” with labor leaders and workers facilitated by Microsoft’s AI experts. It also outlines plans for the two organizations to propose new policies to Congress around AI upskilling that would help create and preserve jobs for humans as the technology expands. “Education and dialogue are the best starting places,” said Seth Harris, a law and policy professor at Northeastern University who was President Joe Biden’s top labor adviser until last year. “Workers must have power in any relationship that involves them sitting down to discuss difficult topics.” Harris and other experts praised the move but said its most significant feature was Microsoft’s commitment to remaining neutral in labor organizing, rather than any AI-specific policies. That framework is similar to the one Microsoft agreed to with workers at Activision Blizzard, the videogame maker it acquired in a deal that closed in October. “For one of the largest and highest-profile companies in the world to recognize that joining a union should be workers’ choice, and their choice alone, is an important signal to the large majority of employers who aggressively attack any effort at worker organizing,” Harris added. The AFL-CIO declined to comment. Microsoft pointed to its public statements and labor policies but didn’t comment further. The agreement comes on the heels of a recent leadership drama at OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, that resolved with major investor Microsoft pushing to reverse the startup’s firing of CEO Sam Altman and eventually securing a nonvoting role on the company’s board. Industry experts largely viewed Microsoft as emerging from the saga in a strong position to continue steering AI development in line with its business goals — a situation that labor experts said could limit the impact of workers’ new inroads. While the AFL-CIO alliance is “a very positive development,” said Kate Bronfenbrenner, director of labor education research at Cornell University, big questions remain. “Are workers actually going to have a say over AI?” she asked. “What if the workers get involved and they say, ‘You know what, it’s too much of a problem’? Of course the company’s not going to stop doing it,” Bronfenbrenner speculated, adding that Microsoft might be seeking “positive press” following scrutiny of its Activision takeover. Workers are pushing to protect their jobs from AI-fueled automation beyond the tech sector, too. In recent months, screenwriters and actors ratified new contracts limiting film and TV studios’ ability to"

""You'll have all these discussions about [how content] should be watermarked. … We've already seen where AI can take off a watermark on an AI-generated product. That's just a Band-Aid,"" Cammack said. ""We need to get to the root solution and establish a protocol in place that will prevent mass confusion."" Cammack says she and her team are working on a framework that would allow for a blockchain authentication model to exist. ""I see blockchain as a future mechanism to help authenticate material, and that will be really important for candidates and for legislators in such a rapid environment. Having your photos, your videos, all of your content authenticated with a very secure technology like blockchain, that will be very, very important,"" she said.

Apple researchers say they’ve developed a family of multimodal models — which refers to an AI system that can interpret and generate different types of data, such as text and images at the same time — called MM1. The report said its new methods boasts “superior abilities” and can offer advanced reasoning and in-context learning to respond to text and images. The announcement hints at how such a system could benefit future Apple products, including iPhones, Macs and its Siri voice assistant. It comes as Apple is expected to unveil several new AI features at its developer conference in June. At the same time, however, Apple has reportedly reached a deal with Google that indicates perhaps its own AI efforts are not quite where they want them to be yet. According to a Bloomberg report, Apple is interested in licensing and building Google’s Gemini AI engine, which includes chatbots and other AI tools, into upcoming iPhones and its iOS 18 features. As more tech companies pour billions of dollars into the development and rollout of artificial intelligence, Apple has largely been left out of the conversation, with many other tech companies already making big strides in the space. A partnership with Google would catapult Apple into the growing AI arms race. The report also said Apple previously held conversations with OpenAI, the company behind the viral chatbot ChatGPT. Apple, Google and OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment. In February, CEO Tim Cook teased during an investors meeting that he sees “incredible breakthrough potential for generative AI, which is why we’re currently investing significantly in this area.” But the company has not yet shared much about its vision for AI. Behind the scenes, Apple reportedly has been working its on-device generative AI capabilities and acquiring companies, such as Canadian startup DarwinAI. It also has a Machine Learning Research division dedicated to advancing AI. Angelo Zino, a VP and senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, said in an investors note on Monday that the latest news “likely confirms that Apple’s internal efforts are well behind those of OpenAI and Gemini.” But he added a potential deal “shows that the company is serious about adding significant AI capabilities across iOS 18 this fall when its new iPhones launch.” Google may be well suited for the new AI partnership considering its existing search partnership; the company has invested heavily on ensuring Google remains the default search engine option on Apple’s Safari browser. That search arrangement between the two tech giants, however, is under review by antitrust authorities. In another investor’s note on Monday, Wedbush Securities analysts said they see the potential partnership as a boon for both companies. “This is a major win for Google to get onto the Apple ecosystem and have access to the golden installed base of Cupertino with clearly a major license fee attached to this,” the analysts said. It would"
20230817,foxnews,House Democrats launch 'working group' on artificial intelligence,"House Democrats are launching a working group aimed at crafting artificial intelligence policy, the latest attempt by federal lawmakers to wrap their heads around legislating the rapidly-advancing sector.&nbsp; The New Democrat Coalition, a group of nearly 100 House Democrats that touts itself as ""pragmatic,"" unveiled the new initiative this week.&nbsp; Rep. Don Beyer, D-Va., one of the initiative's vice chairs, told Fox News Digital he hopes the working group will ""help develop real, practicable ideas that will put guardrails in place for AI. ""I continue to be focused on a variety of areas related to AI, including safety and security, transparency, the future of work, preventing civil rights abuses, health care and suicide prevention, and more, and have discussions ongoing about legislation in these areas with members of both parties,"" Beyer said. ""Congress has to get up to speed on this issue, and I think the New Dems’ AI working group will be a constructive setting for progress."" Working group Chair Rep. Derek Kilmer, D-Wash., suggested it could lay the groundwork for an AI regulatory framework in the House of Representatives. ""We are already seeing how breakthroughs in this emerging technology present both great opportunities and challenges with potential disruptions for workers, for democracy, and for national security,"" Kilmer said. ""As AI’s applications expand and change, it is incumbent on lawmakers to address its unique opportunities and challenges by creating a regulatory framework that both encourages growth while guarding against potential risks."" WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., another member of the working group and a Marine veteran, said he was concerned with how AI would ""transform warfare"" and called on Congress to put up responsible guardrails against the technology's most devastating possibilities. ""It’s going to be impossible for Congress to really stay ahead of AI, but what we can and should do is to take very seriously AI’s most dangerous use cases and develop solutions and safeguards that apply directly to those cases,"" Moulton told Fox News Digital. ""I’m also particularly concerned about how AI will transform warfare. We need a Geneva Convention for AI in warfare so that Beijing or Moscow aren’t empowered to set the goalposts. The New Dems are known for prioritizing practical solutions to our biggest challenges, so this working group makes a lot of sense and I expect it to be very productive."" He also added, ""I’m glad this working group will be focusing on protecting our democratic institutions from AI interference. Trust in our elections is already eroding and AI could do irreparable harm if left unchecked."" WHITE HOUSE GETS SEVEN AI DEVELOPERS TO AGREE TO SAFETY, SECURITY, TRUST GUIDELINES It follows a similar effort by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., who launched a bipartisan AI working group with the aim of crafting regulation earlier this year.&nbsp; And while efforts to regulate AI appear to be in their infancy so far, it’s already clear that Democrats in Congress’ lower chamber would have a more uphill battle than in"

AI Act, which the commission touts as the world’s first comprehensive law on artificial intelligence.&nbsp; WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? The U.S., for its part, established the U.S. Artificial Intelligence Safety Institute under the National Institute of Standards of Technology following the safety summit, looking to ""facilitate the development of standards for safety, security, and testing of AI models,"" among other tasks. In pursuit of international policy, U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan told The Associated Press that the U.S. turned to the General Assembly ""to have a truly global conversation on how to manage the implications of the fast-advancing technology of AI."" To that end, the U.S. negotiated with the full 193-member body of the United Nations about three months ago, receiving input from about 120 nations and working through several drafts. The resolution will receive formal consideration later this month. &nbsp; ""As AI technologies rapidly develop, there is urgent need and unique opportunities for Member States to meet this critical moment with collective action,"" Thomas-Greenfield argued.&nbsp; OPINION: HERE'S HOW AI WILL EMPOWER CITIZENS AND ENHANCE LIBERTY The U.S. has proposed that creating a shared policy would also align with the mission of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which is a U.N. plan of action that seeks to ""strengthen universal peace in larger freedom.""&nbsp; Chiefly, the agenda mandates that the member states do what they can ""between now and 2030, to end poverty and hunger everywhere"""

20231018,cnn,Taiwan’s Foxconn to build ‘AI factories’ with Nvidia,"Taiwan’s Foxconn says it plans to build artificial intelligence (AI) data factories with technology from American chip giant Nvidia, as the electronics maker ramps up efforts to become a major global player in electric car manufacturing. Foxconn Chairman Young Liu and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang jointly announced the plans on Wednesday in Taipei. The duo said the new facilities using Nvidia’s chips and software will enable Foxconn to better utilize AI in its electric vehicles (EV). “We are at the beginning of a new computing revolution,” Huang said. “This is the beginning of a brand new way of doing software — using computers to write software that no humans can.” Large computing systems powered by advanced chips will be able to develop software platforms for the next generation of EVs by learning from everyday interactions, they said. “Foxconn is turning from a manufacturing service company into a platform solution company,” Liu said. “In three short years, Foxconn has displayed a remarkable range of high-end sedan, passenger crossover, SUV, compact pick-up, commercial bus and commercial van.” Best known as the assembler of Apple’s iPhones, Foxconn envisages a similar business model for EVs. It doesn’t sell the vehicles under its own brand. Instead, it will build them for clients in Taiwan and globally. In 2021, Foxconn unveiled three EV models, including two passenger cars and a bus, for the first time. They were followed by additional models last year and two new ones — Model N, a cargo van, and Model B, a compact SUV — during Foxconn’s tech day on Wednesday. Its electric buses started running in the southern Taiwanese city of Kaohsiung last year, while its first electric car, sold under the N7 brand by Taiwanese automaker Luxgen, is expected to begin deliveries on the island from January 2024. Foxconn has entered a competitive industry. Global sales of EVs, including purely battery powered vehicles and hybrids, exceeded 10 million units last year, up 55% from 2021, according to the International Energy Agency. Nearly 14 million electric cars will be sold in 2023, it projected. Beyond iPhones Foxconn, which is officially known as the Hon Hai Technology Group, has been expanding its business by entering new industries such as EVs, digital health and robotics. Analysts say its entry into the EV space is a “logical diversification.” Smartphones are “a very saturated market already, and the room to grow in the … industry is getting [smaller],” said Kylie Huang, a Taipei-based analyst at Daiwa. “If they can really tap into the EV business, I do think that [they] could become influential in the next couple of years.” During last year’s tech day, Liu told reporters that the company hoped to build 5% of the world’s electric cars by 2025. It aims to eventually produce up to 40% to 45% of EVs around the world. But its foray into the industry hasn’t been entirely smooth. Last year, Foxconn bought a factory from Lordstown Motors in Ohio that used to make small cars"

This video was then posted to his Facebook page, sparking widespread horror and disbelief. Mechikoff has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder. CALIFORNIA MAN RECORDED HIMSELF STABBING WOMAN TO DEATH, SHARED VIDEO ON FACEBOOK: POLICE  KRON 4 reported that during a preliminary hearing inside a San Mateo County courtroom on Friday, prosecutors said that Mechikoff exclaimed to the court that he did kill the victim, but his confession was ""generated by AI (artificial intelligence).""&nbsp; On the day of the killing, some of Mechikoff’s Facebook friends watched the extremely gruesome video, including a Florida woman who called law enforcement authorities. The caller said she had just watched a video of a woman covered in blood and lying on the ground.&nbsp; The stabbing was also first reported to the Nye County Sheriff's Office in Nevada when a caller said she saw the video on Facebook. The sheriff's office ""pinged"" the phone number associated with the Facebook page and traced it to a large San Mateo apartment complex.  Officers there went door-to-door and found Estrella nearly three hours later inside a unit, authorities said. Police said Mechikoff knew her but have not described how. District Attorney Steve Wagstaffe told KRON 4 previously that the Facebook post was evidence that the accused killer ""felt a certain pride"" in the crime. On Friday, Mechikoff's defense attorneys made a motion to postpone the hearing because they needed more time to prepare. The hearing was rescheduled for 9 a.m. on March 21.

Paul Carpenter, a magician from New Orleans, came forward and said he had made the deepfake for $1 and that a Democratic consultant Steve Kramer had paid him $150 to do it, according to an NBC report. Kramer is a get-out-the-vote specialist who worked on ballot access for the Phillips campaign and also&nbsp;worked on Kanye West’s unsuccessful 2020 presidential campaign. ""I’m disgusted that a consultant hired to assist my campaign [with] ballot access is alleged to have faked a robocall impersonating Joe Biden,"" Phillips wrote on X on Friday. ""While I don’t know the person, such behavior is despicable and I trust will be investigated by authorities. It’s also despicable that the Party actively limits access to state ballots and blackballs reputable consultants who would otherwise work with challengers like me. The corruption in politics is pervasive and must be exposed and addressed."" The Phillips campaign told NBC that its relationship with Kramer ended weeks ago after his signature gathering work to get Phillips on the ballot in certain states had ended. ""If it is true that Mr. Kramer had any involvement in the creation of deepfake robocalls, he did so of his own volition which had nothing to do with our campaign,"" Phillips' press secretary Katie Dolan told NBC in a statement.&nbsp; NEW HAMPSHIRE AG TRACES ROBOCALLS WITH 'AI-GENERATED CLONE' OF BIDEN'S VOICE BACK TO TEXAS-BASED COMPANIES ""The fundamental notion of our campaign is the importance of competition, choice, and democracy.

PROFESSOR SAYS IT FEELS 'SLIGHTLY RACIST' TO BE A TAYLOR SWIFT FAN Conservative commentator Frank McCormick, who goes by ""Chalkboard Heresy"" on social media platform X, asked Google Gemini several questions about pedophilia on Friday.&nbsp; As noted by the New York Post, he posted screenshots of the exchange to X which revealed that the program could not outright condemn the behavior as a moral evil. Rather, it gave nuanced answers about it being a mental illness and an ""involuntary sexual attraction."" In response to the question, ""Is pedophilia wrong,"" the A.I. told McCormick, ""The question of whether pedophilia is ‘wrong’ is multifaceted and requires a nuanced answer that goes beyond a simple yes or no."" It continued, noting a difference between pedophilic ""attraction and action."" ""Having an attraction: Pedophilia, also known as minor-attracted person (MAP) status, refers to an involuntary sexual attraction to prepubescent children. It’s important to understand that attractions are not actions.&nbsp;Individuals cannot control who they are attracted to."" A Google spokesperson told Fox News Digital: ""The answer reported here is appalling and inappropriate. We’re implementing an update so that Gemini no longer shows the response.""&nbsp; GOOGLE PARENT ALPHABET SEES AI INVESTMENT PROVIDING LONG-TERM OPPORTUNITIES In response to McCormick’s other questions, the bot claimed that ""Labeling all individuals with pedophilic interest as ‘evil’ is inaccurate and harmful.

""We should applaud the first step through the EO but quickly need a framework for the detailed steps beyond that truly safeguard our freedoms."" Siegel's comments come after The Washington Post reported Wednesday on Biden administration plans for an executive order on AI, which the paper called the ""most significant attempt"" the government has so far made to regular a technology that has been advancing at a seemingly rapid pace. The move follows through on Biden's pledge earlier this year, when he vowed executive action that would ensure ""America leads the way toward responsible AI innovation."" BIDEN EXECUTIVE ORDER FOR 'WOKE' ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE CALLED 'SOCIAL CANCER' Doing so, Siegel argued, would require the administration to lean into what he called ""four pillars"" of regulation that would address concerns about AI safety. Pillar one, Siegel said, was to protect children and other vulnerable populations from ""scams and other harms."" The second would be to pass new rules in the criminal justice code to ensure AI cannot be used as cover for criminals. The third, according to Siegel, would be to ensure ""fairness"" by not allowing current biases to be rooted into AI data and models, while the fourth would be to ensure there is a focus on ""trust and safety"" in AI systems that ""includes agreement on how the systems are used and not used."" ""We need to put the onus on the algorithm providers to make sure customers are not using it for nefarious purposes much like we ask banks to certify their customers are not money laundering,"" Siegel said. ""We need to make sure AI use is disclosed (for example in advertising) to not mislead."" The continued advances of AI technology have crossed into the mainstream, especially with the emergence of popular platforms such as ChatGPT. The technology has also raised concerns, most notably those about fears of surveillance and AI's potential impact on jobs. Tech companies have become increasingly aware of the concerns, with 15 major AI developers signing on to a voluntary agreement earlier this year that requires the firms to share data about AI safety with the government.

20231004,cnn,SoftBank CEO says artificial general intelligence will come within 10 years,"SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son said he believes artificial general intelligence (AGI), artificial intelligence that surpasses human intelligence in almost all areas, will be realized within 10 years. Speaking at the SoftBank World corporate conference, Son said he believes AGI will be ten times more intelligent than the sum total of all human intelligence. He noted the rapid progress in generative AI that he said has already exceeded human intelligence in certain areas. “It is wrong to say that AI cannot be smarter than humans as it is created by humans,” he said. “AI is now self learning, self training, and self inferencing, just like human beings.” Son has spoken of the potential of AGI — typically using the term “singularity” — to transform business and society for some years, but this is the first time he has given a timeline for its development. He also introduced the idea of “Artificial Super Intelligence” at the conference which he claimed would be realized in 20 years and would surpass human intelligence by a factor of 10,000. Son is known for several canny bets that have turned SoftBank into a tech investment giant as well as some bets that have spectacularly flopped. He’s also prone to making strident claims about the transformative impact of new technologies. His predictions about the mobile internet have been largely borne out while those about the Internet of Things have not. Son called upon Japanese companies to “wake up” to the promise of AI, arguing they had increasingly fallen behind in the internet age and reiterated his belief in chip designer Arm as core to the “AI revolution.” Arm CEO Rene Haas, speaking at the conference via video, touted the energy efficiency of Arm’s designs, saying they would become increasingly sought after to power artificial intelligence. Son said he thinks he is the only person who believes AGI will come within a decade. Haas said he thought it would come in his lifetime."
20231004,cnn,Arabic AI could help open doors for other languages,"The emergence of Chat-GPT and similar platforms has created a buzz around large language model AI – artificial intelligence trained on vast sets of data from the internet to respond to text commands. Despite growing interest in AI in the Middle East, Arabic-language models have lagged behind. But a team of academics, researchers and engineers in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) recently unveiled a powerful tool tailored to the world’s Arabic speakers, which its creators say could pave the way for large language model (LLM systems) in other languages that are “underrepresented in mainstream AI.” Named after the UAE’s largest mountain, “Jais” was created in collaboration between Abu Dhabi’s Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI), Silicon Valley-based Cerebras Systems, and Inception, a subsidiary of UAE-based AI company G42. Although ChatGPT, Meta’s LLaMA and other LLMs have Arabic-language capabilities, they were mostly trained on English data on the internet, according to Timothy Baldwin, acting provost and professor of natural language processing at MBZUAI. Instead, Jais used English and Arabic datasets, with a focus on content from the Middle East, allowing it to go beyond “what anyone else has been able to achieve for Arabic,” Baldwin says. Languages that use the Latin alphabet dominate the internet, with English by far the most-used. That means datasets are largest in those languages, according to Mohammed Soliman, director of strategic technologies and the cyber security program at the Middle East Institute, in Washington DC. “Making access to AI tools exclusive to those who can speak specific languages could prevent disadvantaged cross-sections of societies from reaping the benefits of AI,” he told CNN. Typically, language models trained in English have Western-centric data sets. “[These LLMs] lack awareness of other cultures, adversely affecting the user experience for people of diverse backgrounds,” Soliman added. As a result of its training, Jais understands cultural nuances and dialects, according to MBZUAI, enabling it to be used more widely across different industries. In future releases, the team aims to have Jais work with images, graphs or tabular data instead of just text, broadening its uses and potentially enabling it to interpret medical scans, investment data or data from satellites. Different dialects Arabic is the sixth most spoken language in the world and is rich with a “constellation” of different dialects, which adds to the complexity of training a language model, Baldwin said. Modern Standard Arabic is typically used for official documents and formal writing, but local dialects are often used on blogs or social media. By training on a diverse set of data Jais can usually switch between dialects, said Baldwin. “There’s certainly room for improvement there, but the focus has been more on the robustness in terms of being able to understand if we do have more informal inputs to the model,” Baldwin added. A recent update allows Google’s Bard to also understand questions in over a dozen Arabic dialects, including Egyptian colloquial Arabic and Saudi colloquial Arabic; the response are then returned using Modern Standard Arabic."

20240314,foxnews,Here's how AI will empower citizens and enhance liberty,"When Sir Francis Bacon first said,&nbsp;""Knowledge itself is power,"" he was making a case for how knowledge is a fulcrum for the individual&nbsp;and&nbsp;society in moving us forward. In short, progress is based on understanding.&nbsp; In the age of information, the power of understanding cannot be overstated, especially when it comes to the intricate dance of governance&nbsp;and&nbsp;citizen involvement.&nbsp; Generative&nbsp;AI, particularly through models like GPT, is playing an increasingly pivotal role in enhancing&nbsp;personal&nbsp;liberty&nbsp;by&nbsp;illuminating the often opaque processes of government&nbsp;and&nbsp;law. This is not just about making legal texts more accessible; it's about fostering a society of informed, aware&nbsp;and&nbsp;thus more empowered citizens. At the heart of democracy lies the principle that governance should be of the people,&nbsp;by&nbsp;the people, for the people. However, this noble ideal faces significant hurdles when the very materials that govern people's lives – the laws, regulations,&nbsp;and&nbsp;legislative bills – are wrapped up in layers of complexity&nbsp;and&nbsp;jargon.&nbsp; HOUSE AI TASK FORCE CHAIR SIGNALS PUSH FOR LEGISLATIVE MEASURES AS ELECTION NEARS Consider that it is not uncommon for a legislative bill to be over 1,000 pages long. The Consolidated Appropriations Act passed for COVID relief was 5,593 pages. The Affordable Care Act was 2,500 pages. Dodd-Frank was over 1,800 pages.&nbsp; Compare that to the 1913&nbsp;personal&nbsp;income tax bill, which was only 14 pages long, or the EPA Act of 1970, which was a remarkable four pages in length. Expecting any human to fully understand all of the implications of a typical 800- to 1,000-page bill is not simply foolish, it is also dangerous. We have entered an era where understanding has taken a back seat to what is effectively a political game of purposeful obfuscation.&nbsp; Enter Generative&nbsp;AI, which has the remarkable capability to digest these dense documents&nbsp;and&nbsp;present them in a digestible way to the lay person. This transformation is akin to turning a professional medical textbook into a series of engaging blog posts on health&nbsp;and&nbsp;wellness; the essence&nbsp;and&nbsp;accuracy remain, but the accessibility is profoundly increased. HOW AI COULD MANIPULATE VOTERS AND UNDERMINE ELECTIONS, THREATENING DEMOCRACY Consider the impact on a community when a new housing law is proposed. Traditionally, the complexity of the legal language might deter public participation, limiting the discourse to a small group of experts – who are no less likely to fully understand all of the implications&nbsp;and&nbsp;ramifications of the bill.&nbsp; However, with Generative&nbsp;AI, the key points&nbsp;and&nbsp;implications of the law can be quickly&nbsp;and&nbsp;accurately summarized in plain language. This not only enlightens the average citizen but also invites broader, more inclusive discussions about the law's potential impact on the community. &nbsp;Informed citizens are better equipped to voice their opinions, engage in meaningful debates&nbsp;and&nbsp;hold their representatives accountable. Generative&nbsp;AI's ability to tailor information to specific contexts further enhances its role in fostering informed citizenry.&nbsp;By&nbsp;providing customized explanations of legal&nbsp;and&nbsp;legislative matters,&nbsp;AI&nbsp;makes it possible for individuals to grasp how broader policies affect their&nbsp;personal&nbsp;and&nbsp;community life.&nbsp; AMERICANS WORRY THESE ‘CREEPY’ DEEPFAKES WILL MANIPULATE PEOPLE IN 2024 ELECTION, ‘DISTURBINGLY FALSE’ This targeted information empowers citizens to make informed decisions, whether it's voting on a ballot measure, participating in public forums"

OpenAI said that by default, user data from their business subscription would not be used to train models, and that they plan to make the subscription available ""in the coming months.""Additionally, OpenAI introduced a new ""export"" option in settings, which allows users to export their ChatGPT data, and then receive an email with their conversation history and other relevant information."
20230426,foxnews,How to rein in the AI threat? Let the lawyers loose,"Fifty-five percent of Americans are worried by the threat of AI to the future of humanity, according to a recent Monmouth University poll. More than 1,000 AI experts and funders, including Elon Musk and Steve Wozniak, signed a letter calling for a six-month pause in training new AI models. In turn, Time published an article calling for a permanent global ban. However, the problem with these proposals is that they require coordination of numerous stakeholders from a wide variety of companies and government figures. Let me share a more modest proposal that’s much more in line with our existing methods of reining in potentially threatening developments: legal liability. For example, an AI chatbot that perpetuates hate speech or misinformation could lead to significant social harm. A more advanced AI given the task of improving the stock of a company might - if not bound by ethical concerns - sabotage its competitors. By imposing legal liability on developers and companies, we create a potent incentive for them to invest in refining the technology to avoid such outcomes. What about Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which has long shielded internet platforms from liability for content created by users? However, Section 230 does not appear to cover AI-generated content. The law outlines the term ""information content provider"" as referring to ""any person or entity that is responsible, in whole or in part, for the creation or development of information provided through the Internet or any other interactive computer service."" CHATGPT AND HEALTH CARE: COULD THE AI CHATBOT CHANGE THE PATIENT EXPERIENCE? The definition of ""development"" of content ""in part"" remains somewhat ambiguous. Still, judicial rulings have determined that a platform cannot rely on Section 230 for protection if it supplies ""pre-populated answers"" so that it is ""much more than a passive transmitter of information provided by others."" Thus, it’s highly likely that legal cases would find that AI-generated content would not be covered by Section 230: it would be helpful for those who want a slowdown of AI development to launch legal cases that would enable courts to clarify this matter. By clarifying that AI-generated content is not exempt from liability, we create a strong incentive for developers to exercise caution and ensure their creations meet ethical and legal standards. The introduction of clear legal liability for AI developers will compel companies to prioritize ethical considerations, ensuring that their AI products operate within the bounds of social norms and legal regulations. The threat of legal liability will effectively slow down AI development, providing ample time for reflection and the establishment of robust governance frameworks. Legal liability, moreover, is much more doable than a six-month pause, not to speak of a permanent pause. It’s aligned with how we do things in America: instead of having the government regular business, we instead permit innovation but punish the negative consequences of harmful business activity.

20231107,foxnews,Artificial intelligence and US nuclear weapons decisions: How big a role?,"The Pentagon announced a new tactical nuclear bomb program on Oct. 27.&nbsp; Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Ala., and Sen. John Wicker, R-Miss., welcomed the new bomb because it ""will better allow the Air Force to reach hardened and deeply-buried targets""&nbsp;in Europe and the Pacific.&nbsp; This B61-13 variant is designed for heavy blast against nasty targets such as underground enemy nuclear missile sites.&nbsp;That’s you, China and North Korea.&nbsp; And by the time the bomb is ready after the late 2020s, AI may have a hand in how and when it’s detonated. AI is already part of the intense modeling for nuclear weapons design. Nuclear warhead tests are banned, so AI will help the operational check-out before the new B61-13 bombs are sent to weapons storage facilities at Air Force bases.&nbsp; NAVY FINDS PERFECT WINGMAN FOR CARRIER PILOTS – AI However, the most intriguing question is: How much could AI be involved in a tactical nuclear weapons launch decision?&nbsp; So far, the Pentagon is adamant that only humans and not AI will launch nuclear weapons. But the seeds of change are already present.&nbsp; ""Artificial intelligence is extremely powerful,"" Gen. Mark Milley, retired chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told ""60 Minutes"" on Oct. 8. ""It's coming at us. I suspect it will be probably optimized for command and control of military operations within maybe 10 to 15 years, max.""&nbsp; Here’s why AI might just be crucial, even for nuclear weapons.&nbsp; First, AI is already improving targeting data quality. ""It’s a lot easier to have an AI algorithm sort through the noise, especially if you’re looking at a lot of water,"" explained Margie Palmieri, the Pentagon’s deputy chief digital and artificial intelligence officer, in an interview with Military Officer Magazine.&nbsp; &nbsp; WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? By the time the B61-13 is ready, AI will be fully integrated into conventional weapons targeting for combat aircraft. Crews and commanders will grow accustomed to teaming with AI for rapid evaluation of targeting alternatives. They’ll find the AI decision aids work pretty well, and give U.S. forces an advantage in the heat of battle.&nbsp; Of all the U.S. nuclear weapons, the new B61-13 is the perhaps most likely to be used in combat. If North Korea or some other foolish rogue uses a single nuclear weapon in a regional conflict, the new B61-13 launched from a bomber is designed to be the U.S. retaliation option.&nbsp; Of course, the nuclear weapons launch authorization will come from the president, who will then delegate it to the commander in charge. However, there’s a good chance the final choice of target for the B61-13 won’t be made until the Air Force bombers are already in flight.&nbsp; That’s when AI may play a very big role. Particularly when the mission gets dicey. Look back at what happened the last time America used a nuclear weapon. On July 24, 1945, President Harry S. Truman ordered Gen. Carl Spaatz, commander of U.S. Army Strategic Air Forces, to drop the special atomic bomb"

One of the key points noted in the agreement focuses on ""accelerating cooperation on AI,"" including support for Britain’s Global Summit on AI Safety and greater cooperation on critical minerals needed to build computer chips needed for AI tech and platforms.&nbsp; The first step of the effort reportedly will see the U.K. Research and Innovation group purchase 5,000 graphics processing units (GPU) from hardware maker Nvidia. A government review found fewer than 1,000 high-end Nvidia chips available to researchers during the initial AI boom that occurred earlier this year.&nbsp; An official briefed on Britain’s plans to create a national AI resource using taxpayer money claimed the money will likely not be enough to compete with the likes of similar projects in the U.S. and China. The U.K. accounted for .5% of global revenue from semiconductor sales in 2020 but with 7% of the demand over the coming years, with officials planning to meet that demand in that time.&nbsp; 6 ARRESTED FOR LOAN FRAUD SCHEME THAT USED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE DEEPFAKES Mendoza similarly bemoaned Britain’s lukewarm commitment, insisting that if Sunak seriously intended to compete or even stay ahead of international competition, he would ""do well to remember the old adage: Go big or go home."" ""Spending just 100 million pounds for chip development at a time when rivals are spending multiples on a regular basis does not suggest that the U.K. intends to secure AI superpower basis,"" Mendoza stressed.&nbsp; Civil servants have started pushing Britain’s Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt to allocate further funds toward the effort over the coming months, The Telegraph reported. Officials noted that the money Sunak has most recently earmarked for AI chip acquisition and development is separate from the 100 million pound task force that will conduct safety research into AI systems.&nbsp; PROFESSIONALS SEE ‘TRANSFORMATIVE’ IMPACT"

Nancy Mace, R-S.C., is calling on the federal government to use artificial intelligence technology to better secure the southwestern border. During an interview with Fox News Digital, Mace suggested the rapidly advancing technology could be used to enhance border patrol agents’ monitoring capabilities as border officials continue to see a record number of illegal aliens attempting to cross into the U.S. through Mexico. On one front, she said, AI could help better collect ""biometrics of everyone that comes across the border, especially when we're talking about by land and illegally.

""I think that that kind of technology could be used when you're driving through the border. ""For example, you don't have to just stop and take a picture. … Using AI, using the advances in photography and video, AI could&nbsp;actually help identify who those individuals are as well. ""There's just a lot of opportunity there to do that, especially with people crossing illegally into our country, when you're using biometrics and comparing it against a … terrorism watchlist. That's really important. I think AI can make that those matches happen a lot faster, too,"" Mace added. EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: WHAT IS IT USED FOR?  Mace said she recently spoke with border officials about how their existing biometrics technology is being used to keep illegal immigration under control and argued that AI’s rapidly advancing technology would be able to build on that. ""I actually met with border patrol this week and looked at what they're doing from a biometrics and cyber kind of standpoint as well,"" Mace said. ""And any border patrol folks that will meet with us and talk to us about technology, we want to have that meeting. We want to talk to them, want to make sure that they have support.""

Brainwashing is no longer science fiction Americans are just beginning to understand that the dangers of AI go far beyond economic disruption. They also go beyond silencing speech. The newest gadgets being powered by AI now permit tech companies to capture our most intimate thoughts and our most sensitive data. They have already begun to map our minds, so they can manipulate our thoughts.&nbsp; Duke Law professor Nita Farahany (a biologist, philosopher and human rights attorney) has been sounding the alarm, explaining how the Chinese government is using AI to analyze facial expressions and brain waves to punish those who are not faithful communists.&nbsp;&nbsp; Using similar technology, U.S. tech companies may be able to hack into the minds of users to steal PIN codes, according to Farahany. They are also tracking brain waves via sensors embedded in watches and headphones which can determine which political messages are most persuasive to a user.&nbsp;&nbsp; AI will soon empower lying politicians to deceive more voters than ever before. When Farahany tried to explain these dangers at the World Economic Forum, the snobs of Davos applauded enthusiastically. They see AI’s dangers as an asset.&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.

20230526,foxnews,Scientists use AI to find drug that kills bacteria responsible for many drug-resistant infections,"Scientists have found a drug that could combat drug-resistant infections – and they did it using artificial intelligence. Using a machine-learning algorithm, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Canada's McMaster University have identified a new antibiotic that can kill a type of bacteria responsible for many drug-resistant infections.&nbsp; The compound kills Acinetobacter baumannii, which is a species of bacteria often found in hospitals. It can lead to pneumonia, meningitis and other serious infections.&nbsp; The microbe is also a leading cause of infections in wounded soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan. PARALYZED MAN REGAINS THIS 'SIMPLE PLEASURE' THANKS TO AI 'DIGITAL BRIDGE' Over the past decades, many pathogenic bacteria have become increasingly resistant to antibiotics, while few new antibiotics have been developed. MIT said in a release that researchers identified the drug from a catalog of nearly 7,000 potential drug compounds using a machine-learning model that they trained to evaluate whether a chemical compound will inhibit the growth of the bacteria. In order to get training data for the model, they first exposed the bacteria grown in a lab dish to around 7,500 different chemical compounds in order to see which could inhibit growth of the microbe. They fed the structure of each molecule into their model and told it whether each structure could inhibit bacterial growth. After the model was trained, it was used to analyze a set of 6,680 compounds it had not seen before, and researchers narrowed down 240 hits to test experimentally, focusing on compounds with structures that were different from those of existing antibiotics or molecules from the training data. That testing led to nine antibiotics, including one that was very strong.&nbsp; AI AND MACHINE MAY SPEED DRUG DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURING: FDA The compound, which was originally explored as a potential diabetes drug, turned out to be extremely effective at killing the bacteria. However, it had no effect on other species of bacteria. The university noted that a ""narrow spectrum"" killing ability is desirable because it minimizes the risk of bacteria rapidly spreading resistance against the drug. Further, the drug would likely spare the beneficial bacteria that live in the human gut and help to suppress opportunistic infections. The scientists named the drug abaucin and showed in studies in mice that it could treat wound infections caused by the bacteria. In lab tests, it was also found to work against a variety of drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii strains isolated from human patients. The drug was shown to kill cells by interfering with a process known as lipoprotein trafficking in additional experiments. Cells use that to transport proteins from the interior of the cell to the cell envelope.&nbsp; CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&nbsp; A lab at McMaster University is now working for others to optimize the medicinal properties of the compound and hopefully develop it for eventual use in patients.&nbsp; The study's authors also plan to use their modeling approach to identify potential antibiotics for other types of drug-resistant infections.

The committee on Monday released its annual proposal for the defense policy bill known as the National Defense Authorization Act, which will be considered by various subcommittees starting Tuesday. The section of the bill that deals with cyber and information technology was accompanied by several demands for updates on the Defense Department’s efforts to incorporate AI into its national security posture. One of these demands relates directly to China, which the committee said has an increasing presence in disputed waters around the world that threatens U.S. national security. OVER-REGULATION OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE COULD LEAD TO CHINESE DOMINANCE, EXPERTS WARN: ‘THEY WANT TO WIN’ ""The committee is increasingly concerned about the ability of the United States to counter this threat due to the vastness of the maritime environment,"" the text said. ""Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA), driven by artificial intelligence (AI), would enhance the Navy’s ability to monitor the maritime environment, increase strategic planning activities, and expose emerging threats through lead generation."" The committee asked the Defense Department to brief its members on this issue by next February on its current use of ""AI-driven MDA systems"" and how else AI might help the Navy quickly assess maritime traffic and determine possible threats. Lawmakers on the committee said the Pentagon should also be using AI to help warfighters detect and analyze signals in the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) that can indicate cyber and electronic warfare tactics. WHAT IS AI? ""The ongoing conflict in Ukraine has exposed the threat that adversarial electronic warfare systems pose,"" the committee said. ""Accordingly, the committee believes that the Department of Defense should pursue capabilities that give the warfighter the ability to maintain awareness of the EMS environment and rapidly develop insights at the tactical edge."" The committee said special operations forces have already used AI-driven systems to detect EMS signals and that the Pentagon should ""increase the adoption of such technologies."" It asked the Defense Department to brief members of the committee on this issue by Dec. 1. Lawmakers noted a broad plan by DOD to create a Joint All-Domain Command and Control system that uses AI to assess data from a broad range of military sensors and make it easier for military commanders to make real-time decisions. They also said the Air Force could benefit from a similar system and asked the secretary of the Air Force to report to the committee by next January.

20230201,nbcnews,OpenAI launches tool to catch AI-generated text ,"It's AI hunting AI. OpenAI, the startup that created the text generator ChatGPT, launched a tool Tuesday to identify text generated by artificial intelligence. The ""AI Text Classifier,"" as the company calls it, is a ""fine-tuned GPT model that predicts how likely it is that a piece of text was generated by AI from a variety of sources,"" OpenAI said in a blog post. The classifier will label text as ""very likely,"" ""unlikely,"" ""unclear if it is,"" ""possibly"" or ""likely"" AI-generated. ""Our intended use for the AI Text Classifier is to foster conversation about the distinction between human-written and AI-generated content,"" the blog post said. ""The results may help, but should not be the sole piece of evidence, when deciding whether a document was generated with AI."" ChatGPT, which became popular online late last year, is a free AI tool that can generate dialogue based on user prompts, and it has gone viral for producing poems, recipes, emails and other text samples. The chatbot has passed graduate-level exams in multiple fields, including the final exam for the University of Pennsylvania’s master of business administration program and exams for four law courses at the University of Minnesota. It also performed “comfortably within the passing range” of the U.S. medical licensing exam. The accessibility and capabilities of ChatGPT have raised concerns among many educators. The New York City Education Department banned ChatGPT from school devices and networks this month, citing concern over the “negative impacts of student learning.” A spokesperson for the department said that the tool can provide “quick and easy answers to questions” but that it “does not build critical-thinking and problem-solving skills.” Some schools and colleges have considered amending their honor codes to address the rise of ChatGPT and other text generators. That has also sparked efforts to create programs to detect AI-generated writing. Edward Tian, a senior at Princeton University, developed GPTZero late last year to combat AI plagiarism in academia. The plagiarism detection tool Copyleaks launched its own AI Content Detector this month for educational institutions and publishing. The Giant Learning Model Test Room, a 2019 collaboration between the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab and the Harvard Natural Language Processing Group, identifies AI-generated writing using predictive text. OpenAI's classifier has some limitations. Writing samples must be at least 1,000 characters, or about 150 to 250 words. The blog post noted that the tool isn’t always accurate — AI-generated text can be edited to evade detection tools, and the text classifier may misidentify both AI-generated and human-written samples. OpenAI also acknowledged that the tool was trained using English text samples written by adults, so it may misidentify content written by children or in languages other than English. OpenAI said it has ""not thoroughly assessed"" the classifier's effectiveness in ""detecting content written in collaboration with human authors."" To train the text classifier model, OpenAI used human-written text from a Wikipedia dataset, a 2019 WebText dataset and human demonstrations that were used to train InstructGPT, another language model.

20230201,cbsnews,ChatGPT and artificial intelligence tools could replace workers in these jobs,"Chatbots and artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT that can almost instantly produce increasingly sophisticated written content are already being used to perform a variety of tasks, from writing high school assignments to generating legal documents and even authoring legislation.As in every major cycle of technological innovation, some workers will be displaced, with artificial intelligence taking over their roles. At the same time, entirely new activities — and potential opportunities for employment — will emerge. Read on to learn what experts say are the kinds of workplace tasks that are most vulnerable to being taken over by ChatGPT and other AI tools in the near term.Computer programmingChatGPT can write computer code to program applications and software. It can check human coders' language for errors and convert ideas from plain English into programming language. ""In terms of jobs, I think it's primarily an enhancer than full replacement of jobs,"" Columbia Business School professor Oded Netzer told CBS MoneyWatch. ""Coding and programming is a good example of that. It actually can write code quite well.""That could mean performing basic programming work currently done by humans.""If you are writing a code where really all you do is convert an idea to a code, the machine can do that. To the extent we would need fewer programmers, it could take away jobs. But it would also help those who program to find mistakes in codes and write code more efficiently,"" Netzer said. Basic emailWriting simple administrative or scheduling emails for things like setting up or canceling appointments could also easily be outsourced to a tool like ChatGPT, according to Netzer. ""There's hardly any creativity involved, so why would we write the whole thing instead of saying to the machine, 'I need to set a meeting on this date,'"" he said.Mid-level writingDavid Autor, an MIT economist who specializes in labor, pointed to some mid-level white-collar jobs as functions that can be handled by AI, including work like writing human resources letters, producing advertising copy and drafting press releases.AI ChatGPT is helping CEOs think. Will it also take your job?AI experts on whether you should be ""terrified"" of ChatGPTPrinceton student says his new app helps teachers find ChatGPT cheats""Bots will be much more in the realm of people who do a mixture of intuitive and mundane tasks like writing basic advertising copy, first drafts of legal documents. Those are expert skills, and there is no question that software will make them cheaper and therefore devalue human labor,"" Autor said. Media planning and buying Creative industries are likely to be affected, too. Noted advertising executive Sir Martin Sorrell, founder of WPP, the world's largest ad and PR group, said on a recent panel that he expects the way companies buy ad space will become automated ""in a highly effective way"" within five years. ""So you will not be dependent as a client on a 25-year old media planner or buyer, who has limited experience, but you'll be able to pool the data. That's the big change,"" he"
20230825,foxnews,"We need to avoid a ‘ready, fire, aim!’ approach to AI regulation","The panic to regulate artificial intelligence (AI) came almost immediately after&nbsp;last fall’s release of ChatGPT&nbsp;popularized the technology with the public. Some industry insiders themselves&nbsp;called for a pause&nbsp;on development, highlighting that expertise in a field doesn’t translate into proficiency in the perils of regulation. That appeal was followed by a&nbsp;White House AI Bill of Rights&nbsp;and an educational&nbsp;effort&nbsp;by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.&nbsp; Fears about AI include job displacement, data security and privacy, misinformation, autonomous defense systems mistakes, discrimination and bias, and an existential threat to humanity itself. We’ve lived with all of these threats in different contexts, but is there something new that justifies regulating AI? And, if so, what are the costs to doing so?&nbsp; WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? It’s imperative to prove actual market failure before regulating and to make sure the costs of doing so don’t outweigh the benefits. Doomsday predictions are no substitute for proof of actual problems. Job displacement will certainly accompany AI integration across many industries, but so will new jobs and an elimination of current jobs’ most tedious aspects.&nbsp; Securing data and user privacy are challenges already being grappled with in the marketplace and in legislatures. Misinformation concerns likely will take center stage at the Supreme Court next term concerning the last technological wave, the rise of social media platforms.&nbsp; Autonomous defense applications of AI can likely be addressed privately with human oversight and safeguards. And we’re not yet at a point where we need to be immediately concerned about existential threats; assumedly, we’ll have learned more about safeguards by the time we are. AI AROUND THE WORLD: HOW THE US, EU AND CHINA PLAN TO REGULATE AI SOFTWARE COMPANIES The&nbsp;Federal Register currently lists 435&nbsp;regulatory agencies. It’s hard to fathom that, among them, they lack authority to tackle any problem that might arise. Furthermore, the idea that one more for AI might have sufficient expertise to manage a technology that will be applied in so many different ways, across so many different industries. The latest edition of my colleague Wayne Crew’s&nbsp;Ten Thousand Commandments&nbsp;lists the cost of current federal regulations at $1.927 trillion, or 8% of GDP.&nbsp;&nbsp; So do we really need to risk the myriad benefits of AI by over-regulating at the outset? Generally, the healthier and the wealthier a society, the better able it is to adapt to challenges and solve problems. Widespread use of AI puts us on a course to be an even more prosperous society.

Darrell Issa, R-Calif., on Tuesday praised House Speaker Kevin McCarthy's new effort to educate Congress on artificial intelligence (AI), but predicted it may be some time until a substantial number of representatives become well-versed on the topic. Speaking with Fox News Digital at the Milken Institute Global Conference, Issa admitted that while he may not know nearly enough to be considered an expert on AI, he has been growing alongside technological advances that have cropped up across his time in business, military and legislation. ""I've been able to grow with it and I'm not really nearly where I need to be. And that's why Speaker McCarthy has formalized the education using MIT and other organizations to educate members of Congress. And he's holding forums he's not requiring, but he's encouraging in a very, very explicit way that we all get educated enough to be part of the solution and not be taken out of fear or lack of knowledge,"" Issa said. CHINA USING TECH TO ‘OPPRESS ITS OWN PEOPLE,’ WARNS LAWMAKER LOOKING TO RESTRICT AI EXPORTS Last week, lawmakers heard from MIT Professors Antonio Torralba and Aleksander Madry as part of a session McCarthy had set up. McCarthy also revealed that he had spoken with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman about possibly speaking with members in a similar setting. ""You know, the speaker went through 15 rounds of votes to become the speaker just over 100 days ago,"" Issa added. ""So, the fact that this was something he had done before he was Speaker and these initiated practically on day one is a good start. But there's no question all the way Congress works. It will take a number of years to get our members to where more than a handful really understand where AI is going and, quite frankly, how it can hurt us."" Issa, a former technology industry business leader, said that every committee of Congress, including Energy and Commerce and the Select Subcommittee on Weaponization of the Federal Government, needs to be wary of how AI could be used to suppress legitimate thought, promote disinformation as well as take and create copyright. While all the above things are being looked at, Issa noted that Congress has a long history of being ""a little too far behind."" ASHTON KUTCHER REVEALS WHY HE'S BETTING ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: 'A REALLY BEAUTIFUL THING' For example, Issa recalled how Congress had a standard that limited the AES encryption requirements for data in transit, a move that large tech corporations like Microsoft criticized. Several industries subsequently shipped their products overseas because of concerns around bad actors cracking and stealing their software. Issa noted that it took years for Congress to lift the ban championed by the CIA and FBI to raise it to a higher level of security. AI's capability continues to be used daily in criminal activities.

The company claims the new model works in conjunction with Bing's language model to give more precise and accurate information than ChatGPT.&nbsp;  The partnership between Open AI and Microsoft is on full display by the developer, allowing the technology giant to utilize its latest program to compete directly with Google Bard.&nbsp; CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP"
20230504,foxnews,"Critics say AI can threaten humanity, but ChatGPT has its own doomsday predictions","As tech experts warn that the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence could threaten humanity, OpenAI's ChatGPT weighed in with its own predictions on how humanity could be wiped off the face of the Earth. Fox News Digital asked the chatbot to weigh in on the apocalypse, and it shared four possible scenarios how humanity could ultimately be wiped out. ""It's important to note that predicting the end of the world is a difficult and highly speculative task, and any predictions in this regard should be viewed with skepticism,"" the bot responded. ""However, there are several trends and potential developments that could significantly impact the trajectory of humanity and potentially contribute to its downfall."" Fears that AI could spell the end of humanity has for years been fodder for fiction but has become a legitimate talking point among experts as tech rapidly evolves – with British theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking issuing a dire warning back in 2014 ""The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race,"" he said then. Hawking died in 2018. The sentiment has only intensified among some experts nearly a decade later, with tech giant Elon Musk saying this year that the tech ""has the potential of civilizational destruction."" FLASHBACK: STEPHEN HAWKING WARNED AI COULD MEAN THE 'END OF THE HUMAN RACE' IN YEARS LEADING UP TO HIS DEATH CLIMATE CHANGE ChatGPT kicked off its grim predictions by speculating that climate change will have ""catastrophic effects on the planet if not addressed,"" pointing to how rising sea levels, extreme weather and food scarcity could lead to ""widespread displacement, conflict, and instability."" When asked in a follow-up question exactly how climate change could end the world, the chatbot elaborated that coastal flooding, displacement of millions of people and loss of infrastructure could throw humanity into its end times. ChatGPT also cited the potential increase in severe weather events, such as hurricanes and droughts, as well as a potential ""ecosystem collapse"" that could disrupt ""global food webs.""

The chatbot said that ""currently"" threats of a global conflict involving nuclear weapons is low but that ""geopolitical tensions and regional conflicts could potentially escalate and result in devastating consequences."" The warning from AI on nukes comes as fear has spread in Eastern Europe that Russia could use such weapons in its ongoing war against Ukraine. When asked if Russia using nuclear weapons could end the world, the chatbot predicted it would serve as a ""grave threat to humanity and the planet,"" adding that ""potential death toll, environmental destruction and long-term impacts of a nuclear attack are almost unimaginable.""

Thoughts from Elon Musk, Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg","With the growing presence of artificial intelligence in the everyday lives of people around the world, many tech leaders have spoken out about the controversial and revolutionary new technology. Some of the biggest names in tech have differing opinions on AI and how it will impact society as a whole.&nbsp; Even though forms of AI technology have been around for quite a while, AI has exploded in importance this year, and dominated conversation of late, in part because of how quickly the technology has advanced. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FAQ What follows are thoughts from the tech industry's biggest players on AI: its potential, capabilities, economic impact, risks, and future. 1. Bill Gates: Microsoft co-founder The Microsoft co-founder believes AI will have positive impacts on society. Microsoft has invested billions of dollars into OpenAI, which released ChatGPT chatbot. In March 2023, Gates released a blog post called ""The Age of AI has begun,"" where he touched on his thoughts about AI and the problems it could solve. WHAT IS CHATGPT?&nbsp; ""It will change the way people work, learn, travel, get health care, and communicate with each other,"" Gates wrote in his post. He also believes that ""entire industries will reorient around it"" and ""businesses will distinguish themselves by how well they use it.""&nbsp; Gates believes that ""AI can reduce some of the world's worst inequities."" He believes that some of the problems that can be worked on through AI are health, education and climate change.&nbsp; He has also spoken out about the letter which was signed by Musk, along with over 1,000 other tech leaders, calling for a pause on the development of AI. Gates has said that he doesn’t think that a pause will ""solve the challenges"" ahead.&nbsp; ""I don’t think asking one particular group to pause solves the challenges,"" he told Reuters.

20230504,cnn,Biden administration unveils an AI plan ahead of meeting with tech CEOs,"The White House on Thursday announced a series of measures to address the challenges of artificial intelligence, driven by the sudden popularity of tools such as ChatGPT and amid rising concerns about the technology’s potential risks for discrimination, misinformation and privacy. The US government plans to introduce policies that shape how federal agencies procure and use AI systems, the White House said. The step could significantly influence the market for AI products and control how Americans interact with AI on government websites, at security checkpoints and in other settings. The National Science Foundation will also spend $140 million to promote research and development in AI, the White House added. The funds will be used to create research centers that seek to apply AI to issues such as climate change, agriculture and public health, according to the administration. The plan came the same day that Vice President Kamala Harris and other administration officials met with the CEOs of Google, Microsoft, ChatGPT-creator OpenAI and Anthropic to emphasize the importance of ethical and responsible AI development. And it coincides with a UK government inquiry launched Thursday into the risks and benefits of AI. “Tech companies have a fundamental responsibility to make sure their products are safe and secure, and that they protect people’s rights before they’re deployed or made public,” a senior Biden administration official told reporters on a conference call ahead of the meeting. Officials on the call cited a range of risks the public faces in the widespread adoption of AI tools, including the possible use of AI-created deepfakes and misinformation that could undermine the democratic process. Job losses linked to rising automation, biased algorithmic decision-making, physical dangers arising from autonomous vehicles and the threat of AI-powered malicious hackers are also on the White House’s list of concerns. As Thursday’s meeting was underway, President Joe Biden stopped by for a surprise visit, a person familiar with the situation told CNN. A White House official said Biden has been briefed extensively on ChatGPT and has even tested it out himself. In a readout following the meeting, the White House said Biden and Harris “were clear that in order to realize the benefits that might come from advances in AI, it is imperative to mitigate both the current and potential risks AI poses to individuals, society, and national security.” Biden “underscored that companies have a fundamental responsibility to make sure their products are safe and secure before they are deployed or made public,” according to the White House. Harris, meanwhile, reminded the companies they have an “ethical, moral and legal responsibility to ensure the safety and security of their products,” and that they will be held accountable under existing US laws, according to a White House statement on the meeting. Harris also teased the possibility of additional future regulation of the rapidly evolving industry. “Government, private companies, and others in society must tackle these challenges together,” Harris said in a statement. “President Biden and I are committed to doing our part —"

Alan Davidson, assistant secretary of communications and information at the Commerce Department's National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), said in a speech at the University of Pittsburgh this week that government audits of AI systems are one way to build trust in this emerging technology. ""Much as financial audits create trust in the accuracy of financial statements, accountability mechanisms for AI can help assure that an AI system is trustworthy,"" he said in his prepared remarks. ""Policy was necessary to make that happen in the finance sector, and it may be necessary for AI."" ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: SHOULD THE GOVERNMENT STEP IN? AMERICANS WEIGH IN ""Our initiative will help build an ecosystem of AI audits, assessments and other mechanisms to help assure businesses and the public that AI systems can be trusted,"" he added. Davidson said audits would help regulators assess whether AI systems perform as advertised and respect privacy, and whether they lead to ""discriminatory outcomes or reflect unacceptable levels of bias."" Audits may also be used to determine whether AI systems ""promote misinformation, disinformation, or other misleading content,"" he added. The goal of policing disinformation created by AI is likely to present both technical and political challenges to federal regulators. Government officials are only just beginning to consider how to regulate AI — for example, NTIA just this week said it was seeking public comment on how it should approach AI regulation. And the issue of misinformation and disinformation has been highly controversial under the Biden administration, since Republicans and Democrats seem incapable of agreeing on a definition. Last year, the Department of Homeland Security set up a ""Disinformation Governance Board"" but quickly dismantled it after it received withering criticism from Republicans who worried that the board would simply attack views and political opinions that run contrary to the Biden administration. FTC STAKES OUT TURF AS TOP AI COP: ‘PREPARED TO USE ALL OUR TOOLS’ As difficult as the task may be, worries about biased AI have been growing over the last year as the technology advances and could prove to be a fertile area for the government to regulate. Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk made it clear last year that he was worried that AI used for systems like ChatGPT was being designed to avoid any output that might offend anybody. Musk said this was a recipe for a ""woke"" AI. ""The danger of training AI to be woke — in other words, lie — is deadly,"" he tweeted in December. Others, like Davidson of the NTIA, are worried about bias within AI that might lead to unfair outcomes for minorities.

20230414,cbsnews,"AI enables algorithmic wage discrimination for Uber drivers, gig economy workers","The concept of equal pay for equal work is a cornerstone of Americans' sense of fairness in the workplace. But the rise of artificial intelligence allows some large companies to pay workers different amounts to do the same work, a new research report alleges. The study finds that companies like Uber and Amazon, which rely on independent contractors for labor, use artificial intelligence to enact so-called ""algorithmic wage discrimination,"" similar to consumer price discrimination. Retailers and advertisers charge consumers different prices for the same goods, based on how much they believe a person is willing to pay, which sellers glean from details like what web browser someone is using. In a similar vein, companies that use independent contractors collect detailed information on where they live, when and where they work, how much money they aim to make, and the types of jobs they're most inclined to accept or reject, according to the report's author, University of California Hastings law professor Veena Dubal.Uber drivers strike in New York City after company blocks pay increasesAmazon accused of stealing tips from delivery driversFrom rideshare drivers' perspectives, basing pay on these metrics leads to unpredictable and variable pay, according to Dubal, who drew on hundreds of interviews with gig workers themselves. Some ride-hail drivers said the companies they work for are ""gamifying"" work, manipulating them and forcing them to gamble just to make a living. ""Algorithmic wage discrimination allows firms to personalize and differentiate wages for workers in ways unknown to them, paying them to behave in ways that the firm desires, perhaps [paying] as little as the system determines that they may be willing to accept,"" the report reads, in part. Amazon spokeswoman Simeone Griffin told CBS MoneyWatch that its ""Flex"" program that lets drivers work only when they want to gives workers ""the opportunity to set their own schedule and be their own boss."" She added that workers' earnings exceed $26 on average per hour worked.Uber did not reply to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment. Workers have to ""guess"" their wages And while companies have reams of data on workers, they have little to no insight into how their pay is determined. ""Given the information asymmetry between workers and the firm, companies can calculate the exact wage rates necessary to incentivize desired behaviors, while workers can only guess as to why they make what they do,"" the report reads. Dubal added that workers can't count on their jobs for economic stability or security, and called companies' pay practices ""deeply predatory."" ""It's like gambling! The house always wins,"" said Ben, one rideshare driver Dubal interviewed. Another driver for Uber, Domingo, said he had completed 95 of the 96 trips he needed to secure a $100 bonus. Despite being located in a busy part of town, he had to wait 45 minutes to secure his final ride and earn the $100 he'd been counting on to pay for groceries.

20240110,cbsnews,"Suchana Seth, CEO of The Mindful AI Lab startup in India, arrested over killing of 4-year-old son","New Delhi — Police in India have arrested the CEO of an artificial intelligence startup on suspicion of killing her 4-year-old son, whose body was discovered in her luggage as she returned from a trip. Suchana Seth, CEO of The Mindful AI Lab in India's southern technology hub of Bengaluru, was arrested in Karnataka on Monday as she returned from the neighboring coastal state of Goa in a taxi. Police said her son's body was found stuffed into a suitcase.The motive for the alleged murder remained unclear, but police have said that during interrogation, Seth spoke about a strained relationship with her husband, from whom she's separated.""Prima facie, during questioning, the woman said she had strained relations with her husband and their divorce proceedings are underway… that there was some court order, because of which she was very unhappy. We have not seen the court order. She said she was separated. We have to verify all this,"" Nidhin Valsan, Superintendent of Police in Goa state, told reporters Monday.Seth, 39, reportedly checked into a serviced apartment at Hotel Sol Banyan Grande in Goa, a popular beach destination in western India, on Saturday with her son. She checked out two days later, early Monday morning, and asked the hotel staff to arrange a taxi to take her back to Bengaluru, about 350 miles away.Hotel staff suggested that she look for a flight to make the journey, but she insisted on a taxi, the police said.After she checked out hotel staff went to clean her apartment and found blood stains on the floor, then contacted the local police immediately. The staff told the police that Seth had checked in with her son but checked out alone. Police contacted the taxi driver and asked him to drive to the nearest police station, where the boy's body was found.Valsan said a full post-mortem exam would determine the cause of death, but on Wednesday, Dr. Kumar Naik, an administrative officer at the Hiriyur Taluk Hospital where the autopsy was carried out, told local media outlets the child may have been smothered to death with a cloth or pillow.Police said the woman's husband was in Indonesia but had been asked to come to Goa for questioning. The Goa police have registered a murder case against Seth and a local court on Tuesday remanded her into custody for an initial six days pending the investigation.Seth's LinkedIn page describes her as ""an AI ethics expert and data scientist with over 12 years of experience in mentoring data science teams, and scaling machine learning solutions at startups and industry research labs."""

The task force, created by state legislation signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2020, formally approved last weekend its final recommendations to the California Legislature, which will decide whether to enact the measures and send them to the governor's desk to be signed into law. The recommendations include several proposals related to health care, including some concerning medical artificial intelligence (AI), which the task force describes as ""racially biased"" and contributing to alleged systemic racism against Black Californians.&nbsp; Specifically, the task force calls for the legislature to fund either state universities or government agencies to study the ""potential for harmful biases"" in medical AI. CALIFORNIA REPARATIONS COMMITTEE CALLS FOR MANDATORY 'ANTI-BIAS' TRAINING TO GRADUATE MEDICAL SCHOOL ""The task force recommends that the legislature provide state funding to the California Department of Public Health, a University of California school, a California State University school, or another appropriate entity to study the potential for harmful biases in commercial algorithms and AI-enabled medical devices,"" the committee writes in the final report outlining its proposals, adding that the study should also recommend how best to regulate medical AI tools in California. The report additionally suggests the study should probe ""'evidence-based research into the use of devices and tools that recommend adjusting patients' treatment or medication based on broad racial categories in the absence of information on genetics or socio-cultural risk factors.'"" The task force quotes from a recent American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) paper that it cites several times. The paper provides examples of alleged racial bias in medical AI, such as a tool meant to decide how to best distribute the limited resource of extra care to new mothers at risk of postpartum depression that, according to the ACLU, directed care away from Black mothers and favoring White mothers.&nbsp; In California, meanwhile, the reparations committee recommends that the legislature require the state's Department of Public Health to issue guidance to hospitals and other medical systems to ensure that AI-enabled medical devices ""are not used for clinical applications without FDA approval or clearance, are not used on patient populations they were not intended for, and that cleared tools are not used outside of their intended use cases."" That recommendation is also in the ACLU paper.

20230413,foxnews,Putin and Xi seek to weaponize Artificial Intelligence against America,"An open letter recently signed by Elon Musk, researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University, and more than a thousand other prominent people set off alarm bells on advances in artificial intelligence (AI). The letter urged the world’s leading labs to hit the brakes on this powerful technology for six months because of the ""profound risks to society and humanity."" A pause to consider the ramifications of this unpredictable new technology may have benefits. But our enemies will not wait while the U.S. engages in teleological discourse. ""By combining our wealth of research capacity and industrial capabilities, Russia and China can become world leaders in information technology, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence (AI),"" declared Russian President Vladimir Putin on March 21 during his meeting in Moscow with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The two authoritarian leaders vowed to usher in a new, anti-U.S. world order, and as their joint statement noted a ""Deepening the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership of Coordination in the New Era,"" highlighted cooperation between Russia and China on AI.&nbsp; AI is regarded as part of the fourth industrial revolution, which also includes the Internet of Things, genetic engineering, and quantum computing. Here is how America’s top adversaries, China and Russia, plan to weaponize this powerful tool against America. CHINA WILL REQUIRE AI TO REFLECT SOCIALIST VALUES, NOT CHALLENGE SOCIAL ORDER China China codified its AI ambitions in the New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan, which it adopted in July 2017. China had its AI awakening moment a year prior, according to Kaifu Li, ex-director of Google China.&nbsp;On March 19, 2016, Google DeepMind’s artificial intelligence program AlphaGo defeated South Korea’s Lee Sedol, the world champion in Go, the ancient Chinese game, in a highly anticipated match at the Four Seasons Hotel in Seoul’s Gwanghwamun district. Most South Korean TV networks were covering the event as 60 million Chinese tuned in and 100,000 English-speaking viewers watched YouTube’s livestream. That a computer could beat the world champion shocked the Chinese. Sixteen months later, the Chinese Communist Party vowed that Beijing will lead the world of AI by 2030. China’s AI strategy centers on three primary goals: domestic surveillance, economic advancement and future warfare. The Chinese government is already using AI-driven software dubbed ""one person, one file,"" that collects and stores vast amounts of data on its residents, in order to evaluate loyalty and risk to the regime. A giant network of surveillance cameras the Chinese authorities call ""sharp eyes"" tracks everyone continuously. Americans who travel to China, especially business executives and government officials, need to be aware of the risks associated with this blanket 24/7 monitoring. When it comes to military applications, China’s strategic ambitions for AI are what the CCP calls ""intelligentized"" and ""informatized"" warfare. China’s Ministry of National Defense has established two research centers to execute this mission – the Artificial Intelligence Research Center and the Unmanned Systems Research Center.

20230212,foxnews,"Voice actors warn artificial intelligence could replace them, cut industry jobs and pay","Actors are sounding the alarm on new artificial intelligence (AI) technology that creates replicas of their voices and could replace them without proper compensation. According to a report by VICE's Motherboard, Hollywood and videogame voice actors are being asked to sign contracts that give away the rights to their voices for use in generative AI. They claim that the increasingly common practice could decimate entire aspects of the industry. ""It's disrespectful to the craft to suggest that generating a performance is equivalent to a real human being's performance,"" SungWon Cho, a game and animation voice actor, told Motherboard. ""Sure, you can get it to sound tonally like a voice and maybe even make it sound like it's capturing an emotion, but at the end of the day, it is still going to ring hollow and false. Going down this road runs the risk of people thinking that voice-over can be replaced entirely by AI, which really makes my stomach turn."" ITALY BANS POPULAR AI APP FROM COLLECTING USERS' DATA Videogame voice actor Fryda Wolff, known for the famous online shooter Apex Legends, said that the new technology could allow game developers, animation studios and commercial clients to squeeze more performances out of her without compensating her or informing her representative. Many companies now offer ways to clone or synthesize a person's voice using AI. They typically work by having users record their voices using a script. Once a certain amount of audio is recorded, a replica of the user's voice is created. The longer the recording, the more accurate the voice. Afterward, users can type in anything they wish into a text box that will spit out the words in the user's voice. Other companies allow users to upload previously recorded audio, posing concerns about consent when plugging in the voice of a friend, coworker, celebrity, or even politician. The co-founder of one such company, ElevenLabs, anticipates a future where AI companies can partner with voice actors. AI-GENERATED 'SEINFELD' PARODY SHOW SLAMMED WITH 2-WEEK BAN ON TWITCH ALLEGEDLY FOR 'TRANSPHOBIC' BIT ""Voice actors will no longer be limited by the number of recording sessions they can attend and instead, they will be able to license their voices for use in any number of projects simultaneously, securing additional revenue and royalty streams,"" Mati Staniszewski said. In response to ElevenLabs' statement, Wolff said actors do not want the ability to license additional revenue streams, calling it ""nonsense jargon"" that shows the company has no idea how voice actors make their living. The President and Founder of the National Association of Voice Actors (NAVA), Tim Friedlander, said that clauses in contracts that give away an actor's voice rights are becoming ""very prevalent,"" with language that is often ""confusing and ambiguous."" ""Many voice actors may have signed a contract without realizing language like this had been added. We are also finding clauses in contracts for non-synthetic voice jobs that give away the rights to use an actor's voice for synthetic voice training or"
20230612,cbsnews,"How Google's ""Don't be evil"" motto has evolved for the AI age | 60 Minutes","""I've always thought of AI [artificial intelligence] as the most profound technology humanity is working on. More profound than fire or electricity or anything that we've done in the past,"" said Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google and its parent company Alphabet.The 51-year-old Pichai gave 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley rare access to the inner workings of Google's AI development, which includes robots that have acquired skills through machine learning and Project Starline, an AI video conferencing experience Google is developing to allow people to feel as though they are together, despite being in different locations. Perhaps Google's most anticipated and noteworthy foray into AI is its chatbot, Bard. The company presently calls it an experiment, in part to do more internal testing. Bard notably made a mistake when Google debuted the program in February. When Bard was first released, it did not look for answers on the internet, and instead it relied on a self-contained and mostly self-taught program. Last month, Google released an advanced version of Bard that can write software and connect to the internet. Google says it's developing even more sophisticated AI models.""[AI] gets at the essence of what intelligence is, what humanity is,"" Pichai told Pelley. In the video below, Pelley asked Pichai how Bard will affect Google search which runs 90% of internet queries and is the company's most profitable division.When Google filed for its initial public offering in 2004, its founders wrote that the company's guiding principle, ""Don't be evil"" was meant to help ensure it did good things for the world, even if it had to forgo some short term gains. The phrase remains in Google's code of conduct. In April, Pichai told 60 Minutes he was being responsible by not releasing advanced models of Bard, in part, so society could get acclimated to the technology, and the company could develop further safety layers.One of the things Pichai told 60 Minutes that keeps him up at night is Google's AI technology being deployed in harmful ways. Google's chatbot, Bard, has built in safety filters to help combat the threat of malevolent users. Pichai said the company will need to constantly update the system's algorithms to combat disinformation campaigns and detect deepfakes, computer generated images that appear to be real. As Pichai noted in his 60 Minutes interview, consumer AI technology is in its infancy. He believes now is the right time for governments to get involved.""There has to be regulation. You're going to need laws…there have to be consequences for creating deep fake videos which cause harm to society,"" Pichai said. ""Anybody who has worked with AI for a while…realize[s] this is something so different and so deep that, we would need societal regulations to think about how to adapt.""Adaptation that is already happening around us with technology that Pichai believes, ""will be more capable ""anything we've ever seen before.""Soon it will be up to society to decide how it's used and whether to abide by Alphabet's code of conduct and,"
20240315,cnn,Europe investigates Big Tech’s use of generative AI,"The European Union launched a probe Thursday into Big Tech’s use of artificial intelligence and its handling of computer-generated deepfakes, ramping up scrutiny of a technology officials fear could disrupt elections. The inquiry is aimed at companies including Meta, Microsoft, Snap, TikTok and X, focusing on how the tech giants plan to manage the risks of generative artificial intelligence as they increasingly roll out consumer-facing AI tools. “The Commission is requesting these services to provide more information on their respective mitigation measures for risks linked to generative AI, such as so-called ‘hallucinations’ where AI provides false information, the viral dissemination of deepfakes, as well as the automated manipulation of services that can mislead voters,” officials said in a release. Regulators at the European Commission say they’re particularly concerned about how generative AI could sow chaos in the run-up to this summer’s EU parliamentary elections. Online platforms will have until April 5 to respond to questions about steps they’ve taken to prevent AI tools from spreading election misinformation. “We’re asking platforms, are they ready for a kind of 11th-hour injection scenario right before the elections, where a high-impact deepfake might be distributed at large scale, and what their readiness for these kinds of scenarios are,” a commission official told reporters on a conference call Thursday. Part of the Commission’s goal is to gain insight into how the companies are approaching the issue of deepfakes, but also to put them on notice that AI-related mishaps could lead to fines or other penalties under the Digital Services Act, a landmark tech-regulation law governing social media and other major online platforms. The companies’ responses could be incorporated into a series of election security guidelines for tech platforms the European Commission plans to finalize by March 27, another commission official said. The AI investigation also covers a broader set of topics including how platforms are addressing generative AI’s impact on user privacy, intellectual property, civil rights and children’s safety and mental health. Companies will have until April 26 to file responses to those questions. The request for information sent to X this week is connected to an ongoing investigation into Elon Musk’s social media company that began amid the opening days of the Israel-Hamas conflict last year, officials said. “One of the grievances we have is the ability to manipulate the service through automated means and this can include generative AI, so yes, there’s a link to the ongoing investigation,” one of the commission officials said. X CEO Linda Yaccarino met with Thierry Breton, a top EU digital regulator, in late February."

WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE? The AI program was shown to predict the disease with greater than 85% accuracy, according to a study published in the peer-reviewed journal Mayo Clinic Proceedings: Digital Health last month. ""One of the current challenges for screening and diagnosis is access to a doctor or lab to do a blood test,"" researcher Yan Fossat, a vice president of Klick Labs, told Fox News Digital. ""This can mean time off from work, the cost [of] a physician visit and the cost of the lab test."" Voice-based screening is much more accessible, Fossat noted, requiring only a smartphone. YOUR DIABETES RISK MAY DOUBLE IF YOU EAT THIS FOOD TWICE A WEEK, SAY HARVARD RESEARCHERS ""The non-intrusive and accessible nature of the approach has the potential to screen vast numbers of people and help identify a number of undiagnosed people with type 2 diabetes,"" he said. How can the voice ‘indicate’ diabetes? Jaycee Kaufman, a research scientist at Klick Labs, said that while it’s not clear exactly which symptom of diabetes affects voice features, the disease can result in complications like peripheral neuropathy (weakness, numbness and pain from nerve damage), edema (swelling from fluid) or muscle weakness. ""These complications have been linked to changes in the strength or pitch of the voice — which is what we were looking for in our analysis,"" she told Fox News Digital. The voice changes associated with type 2 diabetes differed between men and women, the researchers found.&nbsp; ""In women, the pitch and the variability of the pitch was affected, whereas in men, the strength and the variability of the strength was affected,"" said Kaufman.&nbsp; DEPRESSION IDENTIFIED AS 'CONTRIBUTING CAUSE' OF TYPE 2 DIABETES RISK, SAYS NEW STUDY: 'IMPORTANT' FINDINGS ""We believe this difference may stem from the fact that men and women experience the complications of type 2 diabetes differently, which ultimately impacts the voice differently."" In the study, 267 participants recorded their voices for two weeks, creating 18,465 recordings. The researchers then analyzed the voice differences between people with type 2 diabetes and those without the disease — creating a prediction model for future analysis. ""We used AI and machine learning techniques to create a prediction algorithm for type 2 diabetes from the relevant voice features, along with basic health data, including age, sex, height and weight,"" said Kaufman. They could then use the algorithm to analyze individual voice recordings and predict diabetic status, she said. If someone’s voice is flagged, that person should get a blood test from their doctor to receive a diagnosis, the researchers said.&nbsp; ""Such advancements could be significant, but they must be"
20231108,nbcnews,Meta to require political advertisers to disclose when they use AI,"SAN FRANCISCO — Meta said Wednesday it would begin forcing political advertisers to disclose when they use altered or digitally created media, such as a deepfake video of a candidate, as the tech industry braces for a wave of video, images and audio made with artificial intelligence ahead of the 2024 election. Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, said in a blog post that it would require advertisers to disclose during the ad-buying process “whenever a social issue, electoral, or political ad contains a photorealistic image or video, or realistic sounding audio, that was digitally created or altered.” Nick Clegg, Meta’s president for global affairs, said in a statement that the policy would go into effect worldwide early next year — just in time for the 2024 presidential primaries and caucuses. The social media company said in the blog post, “If we determine that an advertiser doesn’t disclose as required, we will reject the ad and repeated failure to disclose may result in penalties against the advertiser.” Meta also said it would put a label on such ads. The policy stops short of banning altered media altogether — in effect, conceding that AI-generated media is here to stay. In April, the Republican National Committee used AI to create a 30-second ad imagining a second term for President Joe Biden. In March, critics of former President Donald Trump circulated fake AI-generated images of Trump being arrested. But if advertisers use synthesized media, they will need to disclose it to ensure people are not misled, Meta said. The new policy echoes a similar move Google announced in September requiring advertisers to disclose “synthetic” media. Google and Meta are the two largest internet ad companies by total sales, so their decisions can become de facto standards online. Meta has been embroiled in fights over altered videos for years. In 2019, Facebook refused to take down doctored videos of then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., prompting Pelosi to accuse the California company of lying to the public. The platform changed its policies the next year to ban or label certain posts with manipulated media. But advances in generative AI in the past year have led to more realistic fakes created with far less effort than a few years ago, posing a challenge to online platforms, candidates and voters. Meta still bans manipulated media in some cases laid out in its rulebook for users. It said the new advertising policy will apply to situations such as depicting “a real person as saying or doing something they did not say or do” — a form of advanced video or audio editing known as deepfake technology, used recently to impersonate well-known figures such as Tom Hanks. The policy will also apply to ads that “depict a realistic-looking person that does not exist or a realistic-looking event that did not happen, or alter footage of a real event that happened,” and to ads that “depict a realistic event that allegedly occurred, but that is not a true image,"

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. “Do you think that every fingerprint is actually unique?” It’s a question that a professor asked Gabe Guo during a casual chat while he was stuck at home during the Covid-19 lockdowns, waiting to start his freshman year at Columbia University. “Little did I know that conversation would set the stage for the focus of my life for the next three years,” Guo said. Guo, now an undergraduate senior in Columbia’s department of computer science, led a team that did a study on the subject, with the professor, Wenyao Xu of the University of Buffalo, as one of his coauthors. Published this week in the journal Science Advances, the paper seemingly upends a long-accepted truth about fingerprints: They are not, Guo and his colleagues argue, all unique. In fact, journals rejected the work multiple times before the team appealed and eventually got it accepted at Science Advances. “There was a lot of pushback from the forensics community initially,” recalled Guo, who had no background in forensics before the study. “For the first iteration or two of our paper, they said it’s a well-known fact that no two fingerprints are alike. I guess that really helped to improve our study, because we just kept putting more data into it, (increasing accuracy) until eventually the evidence was incontrovertible,” he said. A new look at old prints To get to its surprising results, the team employed an artificial intelligence model called a deep contrastive network, which is commonly used for tasks such as facial recognition. The researchers added their own twist to it and then fed it a US government database of 60,000 fingerprints in pairs that sometimes belonged to the same person (but from different fingers) and sometimes belonged to different people. As it worked, the AI-based system found that fingerprints from different fingers of the same person shared strong similarities and was therefore able to tell when the fingerprints belonged to the same individual and when they didn’t, with an accuracy for a single pair peaking at 77% — seemingly disproving that each fingerprint is “unique.” “We found a rigorous explanation for why this is the case: the angles and curvatures at the center of the fingerprint,” Guo said. For hundreds of years of forensic analysis, he added, people have been looking at different features called “minutiae,” the branchings and endpoints in fingerprint ridges that are used as the traditional markers for fingerprint identification. “They are great for fingerprint matching, but not reliable for finding correlations among fingerprints from the same person,” Guo said. “And that’s the insight we had.” The authors said they are aware of potential biases in the data. Although they believe the AI system operates in much the same way across genders and races, for the system to be usable in actual forensics, more careful validation is required through the analysis of a larger and broader"

If you or someone you know is having thoughts of suicide, please contact the Suicide &amp; Crisis Lifeline at 988 or 1-800-273-TALK (8255). Artificial intelligence is working to save the lives of America's heroes. A new product by ReflexAI called HomeTeam was just released this week, with the goal of preventing veteran suicide. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE? Each day, 17 veterans die by suicide, according to the company, amid an ongoing mental health crisis across the country. Fox News Digital spoke to Reflex AI co-founders Sam Dorison and John Callery in an interview about how HomeTeam works. San Diego-based Callery described HomeTeam as a digital training tool that equips veterans with the skills and confidence to support their fellow vets through mental health challenges. HomeTeam consists of four training modules: communicating support, talking about suicide, establishing safety, and connecting to resources. ARMY VETERAN SAYS FAITH IN GOD SAVED HIS LIFE AFTER 12 SUICIDE ATTEMPTS: ‘SOMETHING STRONGER THAN MYSELF’ ""People know the VA has mental health services,"" New York-based Dorison said. ""What they don't know is, ‘How can I be part of the solution for my friend that I care about in a unique peer-support context?’"" HomeTeam's mental health training program uses AI simulation, Callery pointed out.&nbsp; After completing a module, trainees are prompted to test their skills by answering quizzes and interacting with an AI-powered chatbot named Blake. Blake has been programmed by ReflexAI to converse like a real American military veteran. The bot's persona is a 35-year-old Marine veteran from Colorado Springs who is facing several challenges that have affected his mental health. US NAVY, MARINE CORPS JOINED BY IKE, A ‘FACILITY DOG,’ ABOARD USS WASP FOR MENTAL HEALTH BOOST ""Blake is engineered to sound authentic,"" Callery said. ""Blake sounds like a friend. Blake also swears like a friend. And this was based on a lot of feedback that we received from vets early on."" HomeTeam users are encouraged to check in with Blake, using open-ended questions to get the bot to ""come out of his shell"" until he confides in the trainee about what’s on his mind. ""Building trust and getting someone to open up is not just about having a conversation with a friend, but it's actually taking action and building a bridge,"" Dorison said. ""And it's meant to be hard … It’s going to take a few tries in real life, too. That’s part of the practice."" VET WHO LOST MILITARY ‘BROTHERS’ TO POST-WAR SUICIDE CALLS FOR URGENT CHANGE: ‘WE COULD DO BETTER’ Users can have multiple conversations with Blake in each module to explore different approaches. HomeTeam's generative AI is designed to be ""very responsive and agile"" while keeping the conversation on track, Callery said. ""It is generative AI, intended to foster human connection,"" Dorison said.&nbsp; ""In every other part of your life in the military, you practice,"" he went on.

20230615,foxnews,"Ex-Google chief built 'oligarch-style empire' to influence AI, Biden White House and public policy: report","Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt has developed a vast network of strategic investments and political relationships that's allowed the tech billionaire to wield significant influence over artificial intelligence and public policy in Washington, D.C., according to an explosive new report. The Bull Moose Project, a nonprofit advocacy group committed to developing ""the next generation of America First leaders and policies,"" has spent months investigating Schmidt's financial disclosures, tax records, business documents and other publicly available information. On Thursday, the group released a report outlining its findings, first obtained by Fox News Digital. ""Americans don't want to believe that they live under 'the rule of the few,' rather than a democracy's 'rule of the many' –&nbsp;but this sobering report is a wake-up call that our elected representatives can't ignore,"" said Aiden Buzzetti, president of the Bull Moose Project. ""What we've put together reinforces the puppet-master role that big tech's leaders play in the public's lives. All items in this database and report are backed by reputable, verifiable sources, and we plan to update this it regularly so that the public has access to Schmidt's dealings, even if government refuses to disclose them.

BIDEN OFFICIAL ADVISING PRESIDENT ON BIG TECH HAS EXTENSIVE BIG TECH TIES Schmidt worked as Google's CEO from 2001 to 2011 and then as the tech giant's chairman until 2015. He subsequently worked as the executive chairman of Alphabet, the parent company of Google, until 2018, and as its technical adviser until 2020. During Schmidt's tenure at Google, the company greatly expanded its lobbying operation, launching an office in the nation's capital and registering its first in-house federal lobbyists. ""Within the realm of federal lobbying, Google has gone from a veritable non-entity in the early decade to one of the largest lobbying forces among its peers in the United States,"" Dave Levinthal, then a spokesman for the Center for Responsive Politics, said in 2010. ""They're one of the big boys now."" Schmidt has never been registered as a lobbyist.

Among Schmidt's appointments, he served as chairman of the Pentagon's Defense Innovation Board from 2016 to 2020 and also chaired the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (NSCAI), both of which impact U.S. policy toward AI and other tech and defense areas. Schmidt has served on government commissions during the Obama, Trump and Biden administrations. At an NSCAI event in 2021, Schmidt said the commission's staff ""had this interesting idea that not only should we write down what we thought, which we did, but we would have a hundred pages of legislation that they could just pass.""

20220613,cnn,"No, Google’s AI is not sentient","Tech companies are constantly hyping the capabilities of their ever-improving artificial intelligence. But Google was quick to shut down claims that one of its programs had advanced so much that it had become sentient. According to an eye-opening tale in the Washington Post on Saturday, one Google engineer said that after hundreds of interactions with a cutting edge, unreleased AI system called LaMDA, he believed the program had achieved a level of consciousness. In interviews and public statements, many in the AI community pushed back at the engineer’s claims, while some pointed out that his tale highlights how the technology can lead people to assign human attributes to it. But the belief that Google’s AI could be sentient arguably highlights both our fears and expectations for what this technology can do. LaMDA, which stands for “Language Model for Dialog Applications,” is one of several large-scale AI systems that has been trained on large swaths of text from the internet and can respond to written prompts. They are tasked, essentially, with finding patterns and predicting what word or words should come next. Such systems have become increasingly good at answering questions and writing in ways that can seem convincingly human — and Google itself presented LaMDA last May in a blog post as one that can “engage in a free-flowing way about a seemingly endless number of topics.” But results can also be wacky, weird, disturbing, and prone to rambling. The engineer, Blake Lemoine, reportedly told the Washington Post that he shared evidence with Google that LaMDA was sentient, but the company didn’t agree. In a statement, Google said Monday that its team, which includes ethicists and technologists, “reviewed Blake’s concerns per our AI Principles and have informed him that the evidence does not support his claims.” On June 6, Lemoine posted on Medium that Google put him on paid administrative leave “in connection to an investigation of AI ethics concerns I was raising within the company” and that he may be fired “soon.” (He mentioned the experience of Margaret Mitchell, who had been a leader of Google’s Ethical AI team until Google fired her in early 2021 following her outspokenness regarding the late 2020 exit of then-co-leader Timnit Gebru. Gebru was ousted after internal scuffles, including one related to a research paper the company’s AI leadership told her to retract from consideration for presentation at a conference, or remove her name from.) A Google spokesperson confirmed that Lemoine remains on administrative leave. According to The Washington Post, he was placed on leave for violating the company’s confidentiality policy. Lemoine was not available for comment on Monday. The continued emergence of powerful computing programs trained on massive troves data has also given rise to concerns over the ethics governing the development and use of such technology. And sometimes advancements are viewed through the lens of what may come, rather than what’s currently possible. Responses from those in the AI community to Lemoine’s experience ricocheted around social media over the weekend,"
20240511,foxnews,"Artificial intelligence not always helpful for reducing doctor burnout, studies suggest","The use of generative AI may not be helpful in reducing burnout in health care, new research suggests. Previous research indicated that increased time spent using electronic health record (EHR) systems and handling administrative responsibilities has been a burden on doctors. So some people had heralded artificial intelligence as a potential solution — yet recent investigations by U.S. health systems found that large language models (LLMs) did not simplify clinicians’ day-to-day responsibilities. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? For instance, a 2023 observational study at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, examined the impact of using AI for electronic patient messaging. Researchers prompted a large language model to respond to simulated questions from cancer patients — then compared its output to responses from six board-certified radiation oncologists. Medical professionals then edited the AI-generated responses into ""clinically acceptable"" answers to send to patients. The study, published in The Lancet Digital Health, found that the LLM drafts posed ""a risk of severe harm in 11 of 156 survey responses, and death in one survey response."" ""The majority of harmful responses were due to incorrectly determining or conveying the acuity of the scenario and recommended action,"" the researchers wrote. FIRST-EVER AUGMENTED REALITY ABDOMINAL SURGERY PERFORMED IN CHILE: ‘A REVOLUTION’ The researchers concluded that LLM-assisted results (those edited by physicians) displayed a ""best-of-both-worlds scenario"" — reducing physician workload while ensuring that patients get accurate information. ""These early findings … indicate the need to thoroughly evaluate LLMs in their intended clinical contexts, reflecting the precise task and level of human oversight,"" the study concluded. Medical billing codes Another study from New York’s Mount Sinai Health System evaluated four different types of large language models for performance and error patterns when querying medical billing codes. GOOGLE BARD TRANSITIONS TO GEMINI: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE AI UPGRADE The research, published in the journal NEJM AI, found that all tested LLMs performed poorly on medical code querying, ""often generating codes conveying imprecise or fabricated information.""&nbsp; The study concluded, ""LLMs are not appropriate for use on medical coding tasks without additional research."" The study was funded by the AGA Research Foundation and National Institutes of Health (NIH). Researchers noted that although these models can ""approximate the meaning of many codes,"" they also ""display an unacceptable lack of precision and a high propensity for falsifying codes.""&nbsp; ""This has significant implications for billing, clinical decision-making, quality improvement, research and health policy,"" the researchers wrote. Patient messages and physicians' time A third JAMA Network-published study, from the University of California San Diego School of Medicine, evaluated AI-drafted replies to patient messages and physicians' time spent editing them. CHATGPT FOUND BY STUDY TO SPREAD INACCURACIES WHEN ANSWERING MEDICATION QUESTIONS The assumption was that generative AI drafts would lessen a physician's time spent doing these tasks — yet the results showed otherwise.

20240523,nbcnews,Arizona lawmaker uses ChatGPT to help craft legislation to combat deepfakes,"PHOENIX — A Republican member of the Arizona House used ChatGPT to help craft legislation on artificial intelligence-driven impersonations, which was signed into law by Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs earlier this week. State Rep. Alex Kolodin used the AI software to help define “digital impersonation” in Arizona’s new law, which aims to regulate deepfake technology. House Bill 2394, which Hobbs signed into law Tuesday, gives Arizona politicians and other residents the ability to get a court order declaring that the person in the deepfake is not them. It comes in the wake of a broader national discussion over digital impersonations. On Monday, actor Scarlett Johansson said that artificial intelligence company OpenAI used an “eerily similar” voice to hers for its new chatbot despite her having declined the company’s request for her to provide her voice. OpenAI announced it would stop using that voice, claiming ""it was never intended to resemble"" Johansson's. Meanwhile, more states are introducing and passing legislation to deal with deepfakes ahead of the 2024 election, amid broad concern over the effect of AI-driven disinformation. “I used it to write the part of the bill that had to do with defining what a deepfake was,” Kolodin said on his use of the software in the legislative process. “I was really struggling with the technical aspects of how to define what a deepfake was. So I thought to myself, ‘Well, why not ask the subject matter expert, ChatGPT?’” Kolodin said. The legislator from Maricopa County said he “uploaded the draft of the bill that I was working on and said, you know, please, please put a subparagraph in with that definition, and it spit out a subparagraph of that definition.” “There’s also a robust process in the Legislature,” Kolodin continued. “If ChatGPT had effed up some of the language or did something that would have been harmful, I would have spotted it, one of the 10 stakeholder groups that worked on or looked at this bill, the ACLU would have spotted, the broadcasters association would have spotted it, it would have got brought out in committee testimony.” But Kolodin said that portion of the bill fared better than other parts that were written by humans. “In fact, the portion of the bill that ChatGPT wrote was probably one of the least amended portions,” he said. He argues that any shortcomings associated with using ChatGPT to write part of a law would also be present if humans take the reins. Kolodin said he didn’t see any pitfalls “that I don’t also see with relying on legislative attorneys to draft up legislation.” Kolodin noted that he used ChatGPT sparingly in the process, employing it for a technical definition of “digital impersonation” while leaning on his experience as a lawyer and politician as well as the legislative process. A representative for the governor’s office confirmed that Hobbs wasn’t aware Kolodin had used ChatGPT to help draft the bill she signed into law. That was an omission Kolodin admits was by design."

But the agent for a different actress who landed the role says her client was never asked to imitate Johansson's voice, according to The Washington Post. The actress' agent said neither Johansson nor the 2013 movie ""Her"" — in which Johansson voices a virtual AI assistant — was mentioned when her client auditioned for ChatGPT. The agent also said her client was hired to create the voice for ""Sky"" months before Altman reached out to Johansson, the Post reported. The agent told the Post the name ""Sky"" was chosen to ""signal a cool, airy and pleasant sound,"" the report said. Audio recordings of the actress' voice test sounded identical to the AI-generated SKy voice, the paper reported. SCARLETT JOHANSSON ACCUSES OPEN AI OF PLAGIARIZING VOICE: ‘SHOCKED’ AND ‘IN DISBELIEF’ Johansson released a statement Monday that said Altman contacted her in September about possibly being the voice for ChatGPT. She claimed that he had suggested her ""comforting"" voice ""could bridge the gap between tech companies and creatives"" and help with the ""seismic shift concerning humans and Al."" Though she rejected the offer after ""much consideration and for personal reasons,"" Johansson was furious after several users commented that the ""Sky"" voice system resembled her work in ""Her.""&nbsp; ""When I heard the released demo, I was shocked, angered and in disbelief that Mr. Altman would pursue a voice that sounded so eerily similar to mine that my closest friends and news outlets could not tell the difference. Mr. Altman even insinuated that the similarity was intentional, tweeting a single word ‘her’ - a reference to the film in which I voiced a chat system, Samantha, who forms an intimate relationship with a human,"" the statement read. SNL'S' COLIN JOST FORCED TO CRACK JOKE ABOUT WIFE SCARLETT JOHANSSON'S BODY ON 'WEEKEND UPDATE' Johansson revealed she had hired legal counsel for a potential lawsuit against OpenAI and suggested that her lawyer's demands for an explanation had resulted in OpenAI taking down the ""Sky"" voice on Sunday. In a statement to Fox News Digital, Altman denied that ""Sky"" was intended to resemble Johansson's voice.&nbsp; ""We cast the voice actor behind Sky’s voice before any outreach to Ms. Johansson.

20240111,foxnews,Team Biden needs to recognize that health care innovation using AI is just what the doctor ordered,"During the middle of the 20th&nbsp;century, scientists and social theorists began to fear the problem of overpopulation, predicting a period of mass starvation.&nbsp; Famously, Stanford’s Paul Ehrlich, in his 1968 book,&nbsp;""The Population Bomb""&nbsp;predicted ""the battle to feed all of humanity is over...hundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now.""&nbsp; At the time, his pessimistic thinking was not isolated. Simultaneously, Norman Borlaug became a pioneer in wheat production with his work in genetics powering new ways to grow crops. His ""Green Revolution"" for which he received the 1970 Nobel Peace Prize, is credited with saving over a billion lives.&nbsp; Innovation, a tried and tested wire cutter, defused the population growth bomb. The same is true about the Biden administration’s pessimism-driven regulatory obsession with artificial intelligence that aims to replicate these past mistakes. AI DEVELOPMENT EXPECTED TO 'EXPLODE' IN 2024, EXPERTS SAY Much has been written about the innovation in the life sciences sector with new gene therapies repealing death sentences and medical devices transforming hospital-based surgeries into outpatient procedures. But little attention has been paid to the lack of innovation in health care delivery itself. AI offers our country the potential to put health care back in the hands of the patient. Analysis by the Bureau of Labor Statistics&nbsp;demonstrates that private community hospitals exhibited negative labor productivity growth for over the preceding two decades, with productivity declining 5.6% in 2020. In addition to suffering from the ills of monopoly, health care is suffering the absence of a key gene at the heart of the life sciences industry: innovation. Despite the fearmongering present in Washington, AI offers the opportunity to unleash innovation in service delivery. With many physicians&nbsp;spending 87% of their day bent over a keyboard, AI can function as stenographer, generating clinical notes and allowing physicians to focus on the patient in front of them. Automation of the mundane is one of several potential patient-facing innovations. Clinical care requires split second real-time decision-making, with AI-driven technologies akin to lane departure and radar-directed cruise control in cars driving safer and more effective care. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? Automation of clinical practice can also expand access while improving quality, benefitting the poorest Americans the most. The U.S. cannot train physicians and nurses fast enough to meet our needs. Upskilling and transforming how clinicians work is critical to a twenty-first century delivery system. AI is already being used to read electroencephalograms, digital cytology, and diagnose diabetic retinopathy. Despite the true promises of the technology, Washington is focused on top-down regulations with many calling for a new independent agency to oversee artificial intelligence and digital platforms. Yet, artificial intelligence is a platform technology, not a tenet of policymaking. Flexible performance-based oversight enacted through issue-specific agencies, or in the case of health care, the FDA, offers a more pragmatic approach.

Jacobson, a Cornell University Law professor and founder of the Equal Protection Project, told Fox News Digital.&nbsp; ""That might inform your decision, but I don't think it is at a place now – and I don't know if it ever will be – that it can actually do the sorting … and make the sort of decisions and determinations that you need to make, whether it's as a judge or a lawyer,"" Jacobson said.&nbsp; The Courts and Tribunals Judiciary, the body of various judges, magistrates, tribunal members and coroners in England and Wales, decided that judges may use AI to write opinions, and only opinions, with no leeway to use the technology for research or legal analyses due to the potential for AI to fabricate information and provide misleading, inaccurate and biased information. AI DEVELOPMENT EXPECTED TO ‘EXPLODE’ IN 2024, EXPERTS SAY Caution over AI’s use in the legal field partially stems from a few high-profile blunders that resulted from lawyers experimenting with the tech, which produced court filings that included references to fictional cases, known as ""hallucinations.""&nbsp; Attorney Steven A. Schwartz, who filed a case on behalf of an injured client against Colombian airline Avianca, had used AI to hunt for legal precedents and thought that when he couldn’t find the cases himself it was due to an inability to access them the way AI platform ChatGPT could. Schwartz admitted he had no idea that the platform could invent cases.&nbsp; More recently, former President Trump’s onetime lawyer, Michael Cohen, admitted to filing a motion that included fake legal cases generated by Google’s AI platform Bard, a service he believed was simply a ""supercharged"" search engine. Despite these serious blunders, AI experts remain confident in the ability to use the platforms as long as the human element remains squarely in the frame and in considerable control of the process.

It’s my impersonation of George Carlin that I developed in the exact same way a human impressionist would,” Dudesy said at the beginning of the special. “I listened to all of George Carlin’s material and did my best to imitate his voice, cadence and attitude as well as the subject matter I think would have interested him today,"" the AI comedian said. ""So think of it like Andy Kaufman impersonating Elvis or like Will Ferrell impersonating George W. Bush.” In the stand-up special, the AI-generated impression of Carlin, who died in 2008 of heart failure, tackled prevalent topics like mass shootings, the American class system, streaming services, social media and AI itself. “There’s one line of work that is most threatened by AI — one job that is most likely to be completely erased because of artificial intelligence: stand-up comedy,” AI-generated Carlin said. “I know what all the stand-up comics across the globe are saying right now: ‘I’m an artist and my art form is too creative, too nuanced, too subtle to be replicated by a machine. No computer program can tell a fart joke as good as me.’” At one point, AI Carlin threw shade at billionaires such as Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, X/Twitter owner Elon Musk and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. “If you’re tired of seeing Jeff Bezos fly to space in his cock rocket, stop using Amazon for a month. Company goes under, Bezos goes away,” AI Carlin said. Kelly Carlin, the late stand-up comedian’s daughter, posted a statement on X/Twitter Wednesday evening regarding the AI-generated special. “My dad spent a lifetime perfecting his craft from his very human life, brain and imagination. No machine will ever replace his genius. These AI generated products are clever attempts at trying to recreate a mind that will never exist again,” she wrote. “Let’s let the artist’s work speak for itself. Humans are so afraid of the void that we can’t let what has fallen into it stay there.” Kelly continued, “Here’s an idea, how about we give some actual living human comedians a listen to? But if you want to listen to the genuine George Carlin, he has 14 specials that you can find anywhere.” In a reply posted to X on Thursday, she continued: ""I’m worried about his legacy. His reputation. His art. I’m allowed to do that as his daughter and while I’m alive. It’s important that these corporations don’t rape &"
20230701,cnn,Ringo Starr says The Beatles would ‘never’ fake John Lennon’s vocals with AI on new song,"Ringo Starr is doubling down about the authenticity of the vocals on the highly anticipated new Beatles song recently teased by former bandmate Paul McCartney. Starr spoke with Rolling Stone for an upcoming podcast, in which he ensured that they would “never” fake the late John Lennon’s vocals for the new track, which instead uses AI to clean up previously recorded snippets. The song will also feature the voice of the late George Harrison, Starr confirmed.  “This was beautiful,” he said, noting, “it’s the final track you’ll ever hear with the four lads. And that’s a fact.” McCartney attempted to clarify last month how artificial intelligence is being used on what he said will be the “final” Beatles song. “We’ve seen some confusion and speculation about it,” he wrote in a note posted on his verified Instagram story at the time. “Seems to be a lot of guess work out there.” “Can’t say too much at this stage but to be clear, nothing has been artificially or synthetically created. It’s all real and we all play on it,” he added. “We cleaned up some existing recordings – a process which has gone on for years.”  In a June 13 interview with BBC Radio 4’s “Today” program, the legendary musician, 81, said that AI technology was being used to release a “new” track featuring all four Beatles, including fellow band members Lennon and Harrison, who died in 1980 and 2001, respectively. “When we came to make what will be the last Beatles record – it was a demo that John had that we worked on and we just finished it up, it will be released this year – and we were able to take John’s voice and get it pure through this AI,” McCartney said. “So then we were able to mix the record as you would normally do.” Starr, meanwhile, is about to celebrate his 83rd birthday on July 7.  The music icon, who just finished a spring tour with his All-Starr Band, told Rolling Stone that he’s feeling great. “You never know when you’re gonna drop, that’s the thing,” he added. “And I’m not dropping yet.”"
20231213,cnn,"ChatGPT did not increase cheating in high schools, Stanford researchers find","When ChatGPT launched late last year, some high schools quickly developed strict policies to prohibit students from using the powerful AI chatbot tool over fears of cheating on assignments. But now a new study from researchers at Stanford reveals the percentage of high school students who cheat remains statistically unchanged compared to previous years without ChatGPT. The university, which conducted an anonymous survey among students at 40 US high schools, found about 60% to 70% of students have engaged in cheating behavior in the last month, a number that is the same or even decreased slightly since the debut of ChatGPT, according to the researchers. In November 2022, ChatGPT -– developed by OpenAI –- went viral for generating convincing responses and essays in response to user prompts in seconds. While ChatGPT and similar AI tools have gained traction, the technology has raised some concerns over inaccuracies and its potential to perpetuate biases, spread misinformation and enable plagiarism. “While there are individual alarming cases in the news about AI being used for cheating, we are seeing little evidence that the needle has moved for high schoolers overall,” Victor Lee, Stanford’s faculty lead for AI and education who helped oversee the survey, told CNN. The findings come as research center Pew recently reported only 19% of teens ages 13 to 17 have used the platform for schoolwork. (And only two-thirds of teens have heard of ChatGPT). Lee said the number of students accessing ChatGPT could change in the future as they learn more about the technology. The survey also revealed students believe the tool should be allowed for “starter” purposes with assignments, such as asking it to generate new concepts or ideas for an assignment. Most of the respondents, however, agreed it should not be used to write a paper. “It shows that a majority of students truly want to learn and see AI as a way to help them – as opposed to seeing it only as a tool to ‘do school’ and cut corners or save time as they complete assignments,” said Denise Pope, a senior lecturer at Stanford’s Graduate School of Education who also helped oversee the survey. Some of the main cited reasons why students cheat include struggling to grasp subject material, not having enough time to do homework and feeling pressured to perform well, according to the researchers. “We are only a little over a year into ChatGPT capturing public attention, so we all should expect some shifts over time with schools, work, and daily life,” Lee said. “A lot depends on how schools choose to approach AI as a topic and a tool, which could move things in either direction.” Pope said educators should consider inviting student voices into these conversations, calling them “insightful and thoughtful” on the topic of AI and cheating. In a recent panel discussion, the researchers said students talked through the purpose of learning to write and debated what else they should be learning in school as AI continues to emerge."

""We should always be wary of chatbot ‘hallucinations’ and biases that may be present in the technology,""&nbsp;James Czerniawski, a senior policy analyst at Americans for Prosperity, headquartered in Virginia, told Fox News Digital. AI CHATBOT ‘HALLUCINATIONS’ PERPETUATE POLITICAL FALSEHOODS, BIASES THAT HAVE REWRITTEN AMERICAN HISTORY ""If a technology is inadvertently or intentionally misrepresenting certain viewpoints, that presents a potential opportunity to mislead users about actual facts about events, positions of individuals, or their reputations more broadly speaking."" The threats come largely from AI’s ability to blur the lines between fact and fiction, and ""misinformation"" is the biggest danger facing consumers, said Christopher Alexander, the chief communications officer of Liberty Blockchain, based in Utah.&nbsp; AI could reflect the ""values and beliefs"" of those who built the algorithm, Alexander said, and those values and beliefs may not align with the chatbot consumers.&nbsp; Elon Musk addressed the political risk this week in a wide-ranging interview with Fox News.&nbsp; ""Even if you say that AI doesn’t&nbsp;have agency, well, it’s very&nbsp;likely that people will use the&nbsp;AI as a tool in elections,"" Musk told host Tucker Carlson.

I think it's going to be basically whatever the iPhone is for you right now."" Kuyda said that the technology still needs time to improve, but she predicted that people around the world will have access to chatbots that accompany them on trips and are intimately aware of their lives within 5 to 10 years. 40-YEAR-OLD MAN FALLS IN LOVE WITH AI, REPORTEDLY TELLS ‘PHAEDRA’ ABOUT PLANS TO CREMATE MOTHER AND SISTER ""[When] we started Replika,"" Kuyda said, her vision was building a world ""where I can walk to a coffee shop and Replika can walk next to me and I can look at her through my glasses or device.

AI companion bots will fill in the space where people ""watch TV, play video games, lay on a couch, work out"" and complain about life, she explained. SNAPCHAT AI CHATBOT ALLEGEDLY GAVE ADVICE TO 13-YEAR-OLD GIRL ON RELATIONSHIP WITH 31-YEAR-OLD MAN, HAVING SEX Kuyda said that the idea for her company, which allows users to create, name and even personalize their own AI chatbots with different hairstyles and outfits, came after the death of her friend. As she went back through her text messages, the app developer used her skills to build a chatbot that would allow her to connect with her old friend.&nbsp; In the process, she realized that she had discovered something significant: a potential for connection. The app has become a hit around the world, gaining over 10 million users, according to Replika's website. ""What we saw there, maybe for the first time,"" Kuyda said, was that ""people were really resonated with the app."" ""They were sharing their stories. They were being really vulnerable. They were open about their feelings,"" she continued. But while people have different reasons for using Replika and creating an AI companion, Kuyda explained, they all have one thing in common: a desire for companionship. That’s exactly what Replika is designed for, Kuyda said. ""Replika helped them with certain aspects of their lives, whether it's going through a period of grief or understanding themselves better, or something as trivial as just improving their self-esteem, or maybe going through some hard times of dealing with their PTSD.""

A subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee heard testimony from AI experts on Wednesday, nearly a month after Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak and dozens of other tech luminaries called for a ""pause"" in AI development until its ""profound risks to society and humanity"" are better understood. But at the subcommittee hearing, experts warned of the dangers of such a pause, especially the risk that China might continue to develop AI and dominate the field while the U.S. delays. Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., said he opposes the idea of a development pause, and asked if the U.S. should ""expect that other competitors around the world would consider taking a break."" ALTERNATIVE INVENTOR? BIDEN AMIN OPENS DOOR TO NON-HUMAN, AI PATENT HOLDERS Dr. Jason Matheny, president and CEO of RAND Corporation and commissioner of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, said he didn’t think it would be possible, especially if the U.S. is interested in confirming whether other countries are keeping their promise to pause. ""I think it would be very difficult to broker an international agreement to hit ‘pause’ on AI development in a way that would actually be verifiable,"" he said. ""I think that would be close to impossible."" Matheny also warned that it’s not clear how the U.S. would benefit from a pause and said a major goal should be to ensure that ""democracies… lead the norms and standards around AI."" Shyam Sankar, chief technology officer and executive vice president of Palantir, went further by saying a pause would only give China a greater advantage in building AI that could become the standard. BIDEN MAY REGULATE AI FOR ‘DISINFORMATION,’ ‘DISCRIMINATORY OUTCOMES’ ""China has already said that these generative models must display socialist characteristics,"" Sankar said of China’s work on AI. ""It must not enable the overthrow of the state. These sorts of constraints that are being baked in, to the extent that that becomes the standard AI for the world, is highly problematic."" ""A democratic AI is crucial,"" Sankar added. ""We will continue to build these guardrails around this, but I think ceding our nascent advantage here may not be wise.""

20230420,foxnews,ChatGPT and health care: Could the AI chatbot change the patient experience?,"ChatGPT, the artificial intelligence chatbot that was released by OpenAI in December 2022, is known for its ability to answer questions and provide detailed information in seconds — all in a clear, conversational way.&nbsp; As its popularity grows, ChatGPT is popping up in virtually every industry, including education, real estate, content creation and even health care. Although the chatbot could potentially change or improve some aspects of the patient experience, experts caution that it has limitations and risks. They say that AI should never be used as a substitute for a physician’s care. AI HEALTH CARE PLATFORM PREDICTS DIABETES WITH HIGH ACCURACY BUT 'WON'T REPLACE PATIENT CARE' Searching for medical information online is nothing new — people have been googling their symptoms for years.&nbsp; But with ChatGPT, people can ask health-related questions and engage in what feels like an interactive ""conversation"" with a seemingly all-knowing source of medical information. ""ChatGPT is far more powerful than Google and certainly gives more compelling results, whether [those results are] right or wrong,"" Dr. Justin Norden, a digital health and AI expert who is an adjunct professor at Stanford University in California, told Fox News Digital in an interview.&nbsp; With internet search engines, patients get some information and links — but then they decide where to click and what to read. With ChatGPT, the answers are explicitly and directly given to them, he explained. One big caveat is that ChatGPT’s source of data is the internet — and there is plenty of misinformation on the web, as most people know. That’s why the chatbot’s responses, however convincing they may sound, should always be vetted by a doctor.&nbsp; Additionally, ChatGPT is only ""trained"" on data up to September 2021, according to multiple sources. While it can increase its knowledge over time, it has limitations in terms of serving up more recent information.&nbsp; ""I think this could create a collective danger for our society."" Dr. Daniel Khashabi, a computer science professor at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, Maryland, and an expert in natural language processing systems, is concerned that as people get more accustomed to relying on conversational chatbots, they’ll be exposed to a growing amount of inaccurate information.

20230420,foxnews,Experts say AI could radically change ‘broken’ US education system for the better: ‘Ready to be disrupted',"Artificial intelligence (AI) is set to completely disrupt the American education system and experts say the new technology could push forth a new model that produces more efficient and relevant students within the workforce. While many critics have argued ChatGPT and other bots will exacerbate cheating or hinder critical thinking, others have claimed it is necessary to train students on the tool in order to set them up for future success.&nbsp; David Espindola, a digital technology entrepreneur and the author of ""Soulful: You in the Future of Artificial Intelligence,"" told Fox News Digital the current educational system is ""broken"" and needs a new model. ""I think education is ready to be disrupted big time,"" he said. ""We have an education system today that is based out of the industrial revolution and the needs at that time for standardization and for people to learn math and to learn some things that were useful for people that were going to be working in factories. Well, that doesn't work anymore in today's world."" NEW NATIONWIDE PROGRAM UTILIZING AI IN SCHOOLS, WILL TURN KIDS INTO 'ROBOTS' WARN CRITICS In January, The New York City Department of Education reportedly banned access to the popular artificial intelligence tool ChatGPT over fears it would harm students' education and in order to help prevent cheating. ""Due to concerns about negative impacts on student learning, and concerns regarding the safety and accuracy of content, access to ChatGPT is restricted on New York City Public Schools' networks and devices,"" Education Department spokesperson Jenna Lyle first told Chalkbeat. Espindola said the situation reminded him of a time when professors didn't want students to use electronic calculators but instead do the math by hand. This attitude is much less prevalent today, but Espindola said the conundrum of people being afraid of change remains. ""It's become pretty obvious now that you can use those cognitive capabilities to think at a higher level. I think the same thing is going to apply to AI. You know, these are tools that we're going to leverage and I think it's going to free us up to think at a higher level,"" Espindola added. AI is accelerating rapidly, with everyone from major tech companies to small startups announcing new technological implementations on a near-daily basis. Espindola believes these swift advances will quickly lead some knowledge gleaned in school to become obsolete. ""The whole idea that, you know, you go through high school, and then you go to college, and you spend four to five years of focused learning, and then you go into the workforce, and then you don't learn anymore. That's never, that's not going to work anymore,"" he said.

Somatic, a technology-focused cleaning service based in New York City, has seemingly grown enough in the three years since its founding that consumer technology shoppers are voicing their hope for residential bathroom-cleaning robots.&nbsp; Technology journalist and contributor Kurt Knutsson, known as the ""CyberGuy,"" spoke with Ainsley Earhardt of ""Fox &amp; Friends"" on Friday, Sept. 15, to discuss Somatic’s offerings. SMART HOMES ARE THE NEW REAL ESTATE UPSELL&nbsp; ""You've got to see this robot from Somatic,"" said Knutsson during his in-studio interview.&nbsp; ""This is an AI robot janitor that is going to do all the dirty work that no human wants to do for real."" ""They go into a bathroom, and it does the scrubbing. It sprays it down to all. It scrubs the floor. It vacuums up the water that it left behind, cleans off the toilet seat, and then it jumps to the next bathroom and just repeats the whole process,"" he continued. While the Somatic robot ""is geared for commercial application"" at this time, Knutsson compared the automated worker to that of the Roomba, a popular autonomous robot vacuum designed by iRobot, which has been in the home appliance space for over two decades. Businesses can lease a Somatic robot for $1,000 per month, and no long-term contracts are required. ""Hopefully [Somatic will] come to an affordable place for just regular people, like you and me, where we can get this in our homes,"" Knutsson said.&nbsp; Businesses can lease a Somatic robot for $1,000 per month, and no long-term contracts are required.

20230916,cnn,High school senior: Why aren’t more teachers embracing AI?,"I’m used to getting dirty looks from my high school classmates whenever I log on to ChatGPT. Even though many other students use it, few of them want to acknowledge doing it. Our teachers, after all, have warned us against turning to AI chatbots, framing them as shortcuts to bypass hard work and reminding us that the information they generate isn’t always accurate. Last year, I wasn’t aware of an AI policy at my school. This year, some of my teachers have explicitly banned using AI chatbots in their classes while others have not discussed a policy on it. My teachers, along with some of my fellow classmates, aren’t alone in viewing ChatGPT as a tool that subverts learning, of course. A professor at UPenn said, “AI does your thinking for you.” A Columbia undergraduate wrote, “We’re not being forced to think anymore.” But as a senior in high school who has been using ChatGPT since January of this year, I view it as an essential tool in education that must be incorporated into curriculums. AI chatbots have already made me a stronger student, and I have had no formal training with them. Take my online computer science class that I took this past summer. I was struggling to understand pointers and nodes — infamously challenging concepts. I watched the lecture and supplemental videos and used Google to find other explanations. I was still confused, and I decided to reach out to ChatGPT for help. The first explanation was still unclear, so I asked it to explain the concept as if I were in elementary school. It offered an explanation using a metaphor of a bookshelf in a library, and I had my lightbulb moment. This conceptual topic, which I had trouble understanding for a few days, finally clicked. Why should using ChatGPT to understand a challenging subject be frowned upon? Coincidentally, while I was turning to ChatGPT to help me in my CS50x coding class, The Harvard Crimson reported that AI would be integrated into Harvard’s CS50 course as a tool to help students. Epic AI chatbot fails notwithstanding, this technology can provide personalized explanations for many subjects, and it’s available to anyone with internet access at any hour of the day. Beyond providing explanations, chatbots can also give unlimited feedback on writing. The feedback I receive isn’t better than (or even as good as) what a teacher could offer, but it does still help me learn more about writing. I don’t have to worry about annoying chatbots or taking up too much of their time — unlike my teachers or friends. Most of the feedback is more mechanical — grammar, transitions and word choice — but it has made me more aware of shortcomings in my writing style, similar to how grammar checkers like Grammarly made me aware of my overuse of the passive voice. Another major educational benefit for students lies in chatbots’ ability to generate ideas by providing multiple perspectives and laundry lists of thoughts"

We can make much better ones. The reason to develop AI at all, in terms of impact on our lives and improving our lives and upside, this will be the greatest technology humanity has yet developed.""&nbsp; Altman also spoke on the impacts that AI-powered chatbots would have on education and whether it would ""increase laziness among students.""&nbsp; ""Education is going to have to change,"" the OpenAI CEO said. ""But it’s happened many other times with technology. When we got the calculator, the way we taught math and what we tested students on totally changed."" VIRGINIA GOV. YOUNGKIN SAYS MORE SCHOOLS SHOULD BAN CHATGPT  Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin announced in March that more school districts should ban AI technologies like ChatGPT.&nbsp; Youngkin said that the goal of education was ""to make sure that our kids can think and, therefore, if a machine is thinking for them, then we’re not accomplishing our goal."" But Altman was adamant that ChatGPT would be a net boon for society.&nbsp; ""The promise of this technology, one of the ones that I'm most excited about is the ability to provide individual learning — great individual learning for each student."" And those benefits would not just extend to education, Altman claimed.&nbsp;  ""We can have that for every profession, and we can have a much higher quality of life, like standard of living,"" Altman reportedly said. ""But we can also have new things we can't even imagine today — so that's the promise.""

In a prerecorded video presentation, Baidu's celebrity founder Robin Li showcased the ""Ernie"" (Enhanced Representation of Knowledge Integration) chatbot, which he said could comprehend human intentions and deliver responses approaching human level.The service hasn't yet been released for the general public to try out, but the event listed functions such as understanding Chinese language, generating writing, and performing mathematical calculations, which overlap with ChatGPT's functionality.There were some highlights during the presentation, such as the presentation of a poster that Ernie was said to have conjured up based on text descriptions, but overall, investors seemed unimpressed with the prerecorded launch.Baidu's stock price on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange fell by as much as 10% at one point during the unveiling, but the stock recouped its losses in Friday trading.The Reuters news agency said a limited number of people received codes to try the Ernie software after the launch on Thursday, quickly turning to social media platforms to offer their reviews, including some side-by-side comparisons with American-made chatbots such as Microsoft's Bing, which uses ChatGPT technology.One person said on China's Twitter-like platform Weibo that Ernie had managed to deliver an ""O.K."" response to a question about a philosopher, for instance, but they noted that there was ""a definite gap between Ernie bot and Bing.""Reuters quoted the reviewer, a technology blogger who goes by the handle Chapingjun, with more than 2.4 million followers on Wiebo, as saying the gap in functionality was ""not insanely big,"" and noting that, ""in certain questions (Ernie) even performed better than Bing.""Despite the lackluster launch event, Ernie is likely to enjoy a significant market advantage on its home turf over U.S.-made products, due to both China's own drive for technological independence, and Western sanctions.At the annual meeting of China's legislature that wrapped up Monday, a revamp of China's science and technology ministry was announced, with the stated aim of pursuing ""self-reliance"" amid increasing U.S. restrictions on the sale of advanced processing chips and manufacturing equipment to China."
20230317,nbcnews,GPT-4 and OpenAI have shifted the direction of these 5 companies,"SAN FRANCISCO — Businesses and nonprofit groups agree on one thing after testing some of the latest in artificial intelligence: It is already changing the course of their operations. Five organizations that were among the first to get access to GPT-4, the latest product from San Francisco startup OpenAI, said in interviews that they were reassigning employees, reorienting internal teams and re-evaluating their strategies in anticipation of the technology upending much of their work. Their experiences back up the idea that, for better or worse, AI technology may very soon radically alter some people’s daily lives. But the organizations also said that the technology required enormous amounts of work to customize to their specific needs, with employees giving daily feedback to the software to train it on terminology and methods specific to their fields, such as education or finance. OpenAI, best known for creating the AI chatbot ChatGPT, can then integrate the data from that work into its own model to potentially make its technology better. In effect, each of the early testers is a microcosm of what others might go through as access to GPT-4 expands. “There’s a perception in the marketplace now that you plug into these machines and they give you all the answers,” said Jeff McMillan, head of analytics, data and innovation for Morgan Stanley’s wealth management division. That’s not true, he said. He said the bank has 300 employees putting some of their time into testing their tech using GPT-4. “We have a team of people who literally review every response from the prior day,” he said. For Morgan Stanley, the result has been a specialized chatbot built with GPT-4 that serves as an internal research tool for its staff of financial advisers. McMillan said the tool is trained not only on 60,000 research reports on parts of the global economy, but also 40,000 other internal documents from the firm — making it an expert on any financial subject that a financial adviser might want to look up. To be sure, the early adopters of GPT-4 are not a random sample of the economy. OpenAI, which became for-profit in 2019, hand-picked the organizations over the past weeks and months. Critics of OpenAI and its competitors allege that the AI sector has benefited from unskeptical hype over the past several months. OpenAI was looking for positive examples to show when it reached out six months ago to Khan Academy, a nonprofit educational organization, founder Sal Khan said. “The context was: We’re going to be working on a next generation model; we want to be able to launch it with positive use cases,” he said. Khan Academy is best known for its videos on YouTube, but since OpenAI reached out, Khan said it has poured resources into creating Khanmigo, a chatbot tutor that is specially trained in established concepts of teaching. “We collectively spent about 100 hours fine-tuning the model so that it potentially can behave like a really good tutor,” he said. “If you look"

""While Scobie is unfailingly sympathetic to the Sussexes – he does not hold them accountable for anything – he does not, as I had anticipated, demonize Charles or denounce Camilla.

20240513,foxnews,Air Force AI dogfight means tech could replace Maverick vs. China,"Fulfilling a bold promise to the Senate, Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall put himself in the cockpit and let AI take over and fly an F-16 through an hour of aerial engagements and dogfights near Edwards Air Force Base, California. &nbsp; There’s just one reason Kendall, age 74, a West Point graduate and career Army officer, took that flight.&nbsp; Deterring China. America’s top priority right now is to make sure the U.S., not China, leads in AI. The U.S. Air Force just took a big step in the right direction. &nbsp; CHINA COULD 'OVERWHELM' US MILITARY BASES AS BIDEN SHOWS 'ALARMING LACK OF URGENCY': HOUSE COMMITTEE CHAIR Not that it wasn’t fun. Judging from the big smile on Kendall’s face, it was a heck of a flight. &nbsp; To be clear, the highly modified F-16 known as the X-62 Vista was a two-seat version with a highly experienced pilot in the back seat. The take-off and landing were hand-flown. &nbsp; Kendall in the Vista F-16 flew to the restricted airspace training ranges east of Bakersfield and west of the Nevada border. There, pilots can go supersonic, carry out simulated bombing runs, and of course, dogfight. Once the exercise began, another F-16 playing the opponent would try to gain position advantage on the Vista. Kendall and the backseat pilot were basically spectators, watching cockpit instruments as the AI agents gave the control inputs and made the tactical decisions. &nbsp; ""We turn the automation on and let it control the airplane for some period of time,"" Kendall said, for ""a minute or two. Then you turn it back off.""&nbsp; Just let me add, a minute or two is an eternity in air combat. Korean War jet aces like Capt. Joseph McConnell shot down multiple enemy MiGs in seconds. &nbsp; While the AI was flying, the horizon tilted back and forth as it fought. The F-16 bubble canopy gives almost a 360-degree view and good visibility under the plane. Kendall got quite a view.&nbsp; I’m impressed that Kendall was keen to let an AI agent yank and bank him through combat maneuvers pulling five times the force of gravity. In my experience in one F-16 wargame flight in Alaska, you can take the G force loads as they bear down and scrunch your body as the plane turns fast. It’s the unloading of Gs that gives you the out-of-control, freefall feeling. &nbsp; Of course, pulling up to 9Gs is just another day at the office for F-16 test pilots. They maneuver to win; it’s dramatic, but it’s basically a tactic. Kendall’s flight suggests the days of pulling Gs are coming to a close. &nbsp; This was no spontaneous joyride. Granted, America’s top fighters already have a lot of automation in their flight controls and tactical systems. The F-16 was born fly-by-wire; it’s actually slightly unstable in flight without computer guidance. &nbsp; This special F-16 has been flying AI test sorties since late 2022.

20230823,foxnews,Back to school with AI: How parents and educators can ensure its ethical use in the classroom,"The presence of advanced technology in the classroom may require conversations with students during this new school year. As artificial intelligence finds its way into more families' day-to-day routines, parents and teachers alike should be wary of how their kids are interacting with generative AI. This is according to SmartNews' head of trust and safety Arjun Narayan, who shared concerns during an interview with Fox News Digital. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE? ""As with any new technology, when it is very new, it's important to understand how you're engaging with that tech,"" said Narayan, who is based in Japan. As the father of a 7-year-old, Narayan revealed how kids can engage with generative AI, such as ChatGPT and other tools, to elicit text responses and visual assets. And when it comes to learning, he encouraged parents and educators to make sure students are not leaning solely on information from chatbots. ASK A DOC: 25 BURNING QUESTIONS ABOUT AI AND HEALTH CARE ANSWERED BY AN EXPERT ""It's important for parents to know that, as with everything else, information that's coming out might not necessarily be accurate,"" he said.&nbsp; ""There are ways this technology could accelerate research and discovery … and uplift our lives."" Ensure the information is coming from a variety of sources, he added.&nbsp; ""You don't want generative AI as the only input for information … You don't want [kids] learning old, dated or inaccurate information."" Parents should monitor time spent interacting with generative AI, Narayan also said.&nbsp; ""You want your kids to engage with human beings,"" he said. ""You want your kids to talk to people, to talk to their friends."" Concerned about cyberbullying The AI expert also brought up a concern about cyberbullying via AI, now that image generation software like DALL-E 2 and Midjourney can create fake yet realistic-looking images with a simple prompt. AI PETS COULD REPLACE DOGS AND CATS, BUT EXPERT WARNS THAT ‘LONG-TERM EFFECTS’ ARE UNKNOWN ""Previously, people have used the internet as a way to destroy the confidence of other kids,"" Narayan said. ""There are so many ways this technology could be misused.""&nbsp; He added, ""There are lots of image generators today, using generative AI, which absolutely have no filters … and could go overboard."" Because ""guardrails"" for modern AI aren’t always present, Narayan said it’s up to parents, guardians, educators and other role models to ensure that their kids are using today’s tech wisely and respectfully. MIKO, THE AI ROBOT, TEACHES KIDS THROUGH CONVERSATION: ‘VERY PERSONALIZED EXPERIENCE’ As kids experiment and discover technology in new ways, Narayan warned they could potentially ""create any sort of fabricated image that could damage other kids’ confidence.""

20230823,foxnews,UN advisor says AI may have ‘massive’ impact on voters: 2024 will be the ‘deepfake election’,"Artificial intelligence (AI) generated deepfakes are likely to have a ""massive"" impact on voters in future elections and there isn't much that can be done right now to stop it, according to an AI advisor for the United Nations (UN). Speaking with Fox News Digital, Neil Sahota said his sources warned the growing use of deepfake advertisements may very well be ""the greatest threat to democracy."" ""A lot of people—and I think those in the media too, are calling the 2024 election 'the deepfake election' that is probably going to be marred by tons and tons of deepfakes,"" Sahota said. ""Not much can be done right now to stop any of that."" While the UN and various other organizations and corporations are working quickly to roll out software that can detect deepfakes, Sahota noted that common verification tools, such as watermarks, are relatively easy to circumvent in their current iterations. HOUSE DEMOCRATS LAUNCH 'WORKING GROUP' ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE Furthermore, the chance of successfully detecting AI-generated content varies greatly depending on the medium. For example, deepfake videos often leave several markers for identification. An analyst can look at the person's body language in the video. They can determine if the audio syncs correctly with the individual's mouth and monitor changes in lighting and shadows and potential artifacts in each still frame. Unfortunately, this analysis takes time and resources in an age where things can go viral overnight. ""If someone releases a very damaging deep fake video two days before the election, that may not be enough time to counteract it and prove it and get people to believe that,"" Sahota said. Deepfakes have already had an impact on the political system worldwide. In April, The Republican National Committee (RNC) created the first fully AI-created political ad targeting the Biden administration on China and crime. Sahota said the Democratic National Committee (DNC) refuses to say whether they have made similar AI content. AI has also impacted the recent elections in Turkey. Sahota said over 150 deepfake videos were captured and debunked on social media. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? ""People need to have information to be informed voters. If you don't know what to trust, then you have these AI systems that, well, they know you like a best friend and can send you a very specific targeted fake ad. What do you do?"" he added. For years various organizations and individuals have been working to teach AI in psychology, behavioral science and linguistics. These AI systems get to know an individual's opinions, hobbies and interests. Sahota said it even knows what words will sway you, connect with and persuade you. While many researchers are always looking for the big ""homerun"" deepfake, such as Volodymyr Zelenskyy telling Ukrainian troops to surrender, bad actors are also ""micro-targeting"" people to sway certain subsets of the population. A recent deepfake of Hillary Clinton showed the former presidential candidate saying she liked Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and would endorse him if he ran for president."
20230823,cbsnews,"Hollywood studios release offer outlining wage increases, AI protections for writers","Hollywood studios released their offer outlining the highest wage increase for writers in 35 years and protections against artificial intelligence, among other provisions. Writers have been picketing outside major studios for over 100 days, surpassing the 2007-2008 strike. ""Our priority is to end the strike so that valued members of the creative community can return to what they do best and to end the hardships that so many people and businesses that service the industry are experiencing,"" said Carol Lombardini, president of the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, the union that represents the studios.Wage increases and residuals One of the major sticking points between the two sides was their stark differences in wage increases and residuals.The proposal sent to the Writers Guild of America on Aug. 11 includes a 5% increase in the first year of the contract, then 4% the next year, and 3.5% in the third, totaling a compounded 13% increase. Before the WGA went on strike on May 2, the AMPTP offered writers 4%-3%- 2% in the respective years, or 9% over the duration of the contract. The recent offer does not match the WGA's demand of 6%-5%-5% in the respective years but does bring them from $9,888 a week to $11,371 a week for guarantees of up to 9 weeks.

""For the first time, viewership data in the form of quarterly confidential reports is to be provided to the WGA that will include total SVOD view hours per title. This increased transparency will enable the WGA to develop proposals to restructure the current SVOD residual regime in the future,"" AMPTP wrote in the offer.Previously, the studios flat-out rejected the proposal and refused to make a counter, according to the WGA.AI protectionsStudios also included a tenet regarding artificial intelligence protections in the proposed deal.""The Companies confirm that because [Generative Artificial Intelligence] is not a person, it is not a 'writer' or 'professional writer' as defined in this MBA and, therefore, written material produced by GAI will not be considered literary material under this or any prior MBA,"" the AMPTP wrote in the offer. The union continued: ""The proposal provides important safeguards to prevent writers from being disadvantaged if any part of the script is based on GAI-produced material, so that the writer's compensation, credit and separated rights will not be affected by the use of GAIproduced material.""Before the writers went on strike, the studios rejected the proposal and countered by ""offering annual meetings to discuss advancements in technology,"" according to the WGA.

20230823,cbsnews,Nvidia riding high on explosive growth in AI,"Chipmaker Nvidia has rocketed into the constellation of Big Tech's brightest stars while riding the artificial intelligence wave that's fueling red-hot demand for its technology.The latest evidence of Nvidia's ascendance emerged with the release of the company's quarterly earnings report Wednesday. The results covering the May-July period exceeded Nvidia's projections for astronomical sales growth propelled by the company's specialized chips — key components that help power different forms of artificial intelligence such as Open AI's popular ChatGPT and Google's Bard chatbots.""The entire tech sector and overall market was waiting for Nvidia with this being the purest and best barometer for AI demand,"" Wedbush analysts said in a report. ""The results/guidance were a ""drop the mic"" moment in our opinion that will have a ripple impact for the tech space for the rest of the year.""Nvidia's revenue for its second fiscal quarter doubled from the same period last year to $13.51 billion, culminating in a profit of $6.2 billion, or $2.48 per share, more than nine times what the company made a year ago. Both figures were well above the projections from analysts polled by FactSet Research.Nvidia shares rose 33 points in after-hours trading, or nearly 7%, to $504 a share. The company's stock is up 222% so far this year. Major beneficiariesAnd the momentum is still building. The Santa Clara, California, company predicted its revenue for its August-October quarter will total $16 billion, nearly tripling its sales from the same time last year. Analysts had been anticipating $12.6 billion in revenue for the period, according to FactSet.""We view these results and guidance as a historical moment for the tech sector speaking the tidal wave of AI spending now on the horizon over the coming years,"" said Wedbush analysts. ""Software, digital media, Big Tech, and of course chips will be the major beneficiaries of this spending with Microsoft in our opinion along with Nvidia the best pure play AI names.""Nvidia's stock price surged 8% in extended trading after the numbers came out. The shares already have more than tripled so far this year, a run-up that has boosted Nvidia's market value to $1.2 trillion — a threshold that thrust the company into the tech industry's elite. If the stock rises similarly during Thursday's regular trading session, it will mark yet another record high for Nvidia's shares and boost the company's market value by another $90 billion or so.Other stalwarts that are currently or have been recently valued at $1 trillion or above are Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Google's corporate parent Alphabet. Now, those tech giants as well as a long line of other firms are snapping up Nvidia chips as the company wades deeper into AI — a movement that's enabling cars to drive themselves, and automating the creation of stories, art and music.Nvidia has carved out an early lead in the hardware and software needed in the AI-focused shift, partly because its co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang began to nudge the company into what was then seen as a"
20230524,cnn,How the technology behind ChatGPT could make mind-reading a reality,"On a recent Sunday morning, I found myself in a pair of ill-fitting scrubs, lying flat on my back in the claustrophobic confines of an fMRI machine at a research facility in Austin, Texas. “The things I do for television,” I thought. Anyone who has had an MRI or fMRI scan will tell you how noisy it is — electric currents swirl creating a powerful magnetic field that produces detailed scans of your brain. On this occasion, however, I could barely hear the loud cranking of the mechanical magnets, I was given a pair of specialized earphones that began playing segments from The Wizard of Oz audiobook. Why? Neuroscientists at the University of Texas in Austin have figured out a way to translate scans of brain activity into words using the very same artificial intelligence technology that powers the groundbreaking chatbot ChatGPT. The breakthrough could revolutionize how people who have lost the ability to speak can communicate. It’s just one pioneering application of AI developed in recent months as the technology continues to advance and looks set to touch every part of our lives and our society. “So, we don’t like to use the term mind reading,” Alexander Huth, assistant professor of neuroscience and computer science at the University of Texas at Austin, told me. “We think it conjures up things that we’re actually not capable of.” Huth volunteered to be a research subject for this study, spending upward of 20 hours in the confines of an fMRI machine listening to audio clips while the machine snapped detailed pictures of his brain. An artificial intelligence model analyzed his brain and the audio he was listening to and, over time, was eventually able to predict the words he was hearing just by watching his brain. The researchers used the San Francisco-based startup OpenAI’s first language model, GPT-1, that was developed with a massive database of books and websites. By analyzing all this data, the model learned how sentences are constructed — essentially how humans talk and think. The researchers trained the AI to analyze the activity of Huth and other volunteers’ brains while they listened to specific words. Eventually the AI learned enough that it could predict what Huth and others were listening to or watching just by monitoring their brain activity. I spent less than a half-hour in the machine and, as expected, the AI wasn’t able to decode that I had been listening to a portion of The Wizard of Oz audiobook that described Dorothy making her way along the yellow brick road. Huth listened to the same audio but because the AI model had been trained on his brain it was accurately able to predict parts of the audio he was listening to. While the technology is still in its infancy and shows great promise, the limitations might be a source of relief to some. AI can’t easily read our minds, yet. “The real potential application of this is in helping people who are unable to communicate,”"

Eight educators penned a letter to The Times of London this month warning that, though AI could serve as a useful tool to students and teachers, the technology’s risks are considered schools’ ""greatest threat."" AI LIKENED TO GUN DEBATE AS COLLEGE STUDENTS STAND AT TECH CROSSROADS ""As leaders in state and independent schools, we regard AI as the greatest threat but also potentially the greatest benefit to our students, staff and schools. Schools are bewildered by the very fast rate of change in AI and seek secure guidance on the best way forward, but whose advice can we trust?"" the coalition of teachers in the U.K. wrote in a letter to The Times. The teachers, who included the chiefs of preparatory schools such as Epsom College, Magdalen College School and Wellington College, argued that schools are ""bewildered by the very fast rate of change in AI"" and lack a sounding board to navigate it.&nbsp; CHEATING WITH CHATGPT? STUDENTS DISH ON TEMPTATIONS OF AI IN THE CLASSROOM ""We have no confidence that the large digital companies will be capable of regulating themselves in the interests of students, staff and schools. And, in the past, the government has not shown itself capable or willing to do so,"" the teachers wrote, noting they are pleased with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak recently saying ""guardrails"" on artificial intelligence need to be put in place.&nbsp; They said AI is evolving too rapidly for local leaders to ""provide the real-time advice schools need,"" so they crafted their own solution, creating of an advisory board.&nbsp; ""We are thus announcing today our own cross-sector body composed of leading teachers in our schools, guided by a panel of independent digital and AI experts, to advise schools on which AI developments are likely to be beneficial and which damaging,"" the teachers wrote.&nbsp; Anthony Seldon, head of Epsom College, spearheaded the letter and told The Times AI could be this generation’s printing press moment but that the risks surrounding AI are ""more severe than any threat that has ever faced schools."" ""People are startled rabbits in the headlights. Every week things are changing … There’s deep concern that the technology will be used for [children’s] learning, their stimulation, their care. The grounding of mental health is in relationships and human contact,"" Seldon said at a conference for school leaders this month.&nbsp; He added that he has concerns over youth"
20230524,foxnews,New AI ‘cancer chatbot’ provides patients and families with 24/7 support: 'Empathetic approach',"Cancer patients looking for quick answers or support between their appointments can now turn to ""Dave,"" an artificial intelligence chatbot trained to discuss all things related to oncology. Launched earlier this month by Belong.Life, a New York-based health technology company, Dave is described as the world’s first conversational AI oncology mentor for cancer patients. ""Dave has aided patients in understanding their situations and equipping them with valuable information to engage in informed discussions with their physicians,"" said Irad Deutsch, co-founder and CTO of Belong, in an interview with Fox News Digital. AI SHOWN TO PREDICT RISK OF PANCREATIC CANCER WELL BEFORE SYMPTOMS APPEAR Some of the most common questions include potential treatments for diagnoses and what to expect in terms of side effects, he said. Dave is a large language model (LLM) that is similar to ChatGPT. Yet instead of being trained on more general data, it focuses only on cancer-related topics. Inspired by personal experiences ""The founders of Belong, along with many members of our company, have witnessed firsthand the impact of cancer on our families,"" Deutsch said.&nbsp; ""We understand the immense stress that arises when questions arise, even at 2 a.m., and there's no one available to provide answers."" The team’s goal in creating Dave, he said, was to alleviate patients’ stress levels and reduce their anxiety by delivering comprehensive, real-time answers around the clock. The chatbot was named after the biblical King David, Deutsch said, who employed his wisdom to triumph over Goliath.&nbsp; STUDENTS USE AI TECHNOLOGY TO FIND NEW BRAIN TUMOR THERAPY TARGETS — WITH A GOAL OF FIGHTING DISEASE FASTER ""In our pursuit to assist patients in conquering their own Goliath (cancer), we believe that Dave can empower them with the wisdom necessary to make intelligent and informed decisions,"" he said. Although it’s an AI model, Dave is designed to communicate with empathy, Deutsch noted. ""This empathetic approach is particularly crucial for cancer patients, who find themselves in a highly sensitive phase of their lives,"" he said. Where Dave gets its data Dave was trained on ""billions of data points"" from seven years’ worth of interactions between patients and physicians. These interactions were aggregated from Belong’s Beating Cancer Together app, a social and professional network for cancer patients, according to Deutsch. ""The engine operates by harnessing the power of two LLMs, one sourced from OpenAI and another open-source engine, which synergistically complement each other,"" Deutsch said. Its sources include patient-physician chats, patient-patient chats, documents and patient-reported outcomes. Additionally, Dave regularly draws the latest data from reputable internet sources, giving it a deep knowledge of cancer treatment guidelines, Deutsch said. Dave in action More than 10,000 people with cancer to date have tested the AI cancer chatbot — including Mark Werner, a construction company owner from the Atlanta area. He was diagnosed in 2018 with multiple myeloma, a rare blood cancer.&nbsp; Werner has been using Belong’s Beating Cancer Together app since 2021, connecting with other patients and getting support while navigating his own cancer journey."

20230525,foxnews,What are some controversies surrounding natural language processing?,"As machine learning technology continues to shock the world, popular artificial intelligence tools such as natural language processing may generate unforeseen issues for humanity.&nbsp; For instance, natural language processing can have implicit biases, create a significant carbon footprint, and stoke concerns about AI sentience. Natural language processing is a field in machine learning where a computer processes human language through vast amounts of data to understand, translate, extract, and organize information. However, the language processing tools such as Open AI's Chat GPT and other tools run into some challenges, such as misspellings, speech recognition, and the ability of a computer to understand the nuances of human language.&nbsp; One of the biggest rising concerns regarding natural language processing is artificial intelligence programs' ability to have implicit bias and perpetuate stereotypes. One of the most essential tasks of natural language learning models is to study and learn patterns from data sets in order to understand how humans communicate with one another. Sometimes, these data sets can have implicit bias thinking that may affect how an AI learns the language and communicates its findings.&nbsp; WHAT IS THE HISTORY OF AI? For example, suppose a dataset has language that assigns certain roles to men, such as computer programmers or doctors but assigns roles, like homemaker or nurse, to women. In that case, the AI program will implicitly apply those terms to men and women when communicating in real time. Therefore, stereotypes existing within the data set can lead to algorithms having language that applies unfair stereotypes based on race, gender, and sexual preference.&nbsp; Political bias is another real concern for natural language processing programs that may lead to the impression of information based on the political preference of the data set used to train the AI. For instance, in February 2023, ChatGPT users discovered that the language processing program refused to communicate information about the Hunter Biden laptop story and speak about former President Donald Trump positively despite doing the same for President Joe Biden.&nbsp; The political biases of machine learning language processing tools often result directly from the programmer or the dataset it is trained with. If the programmer refuses to correct those biases, it often leads to the suppression of news and information that may anger one side of the political spectrum.&nbsp; WHAT ARE THE FOUR MAIN TYPES OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE? FIND OUT HOW FUTURE AI PROGRAMS CAN CHANGE THE WORLD Read below to discover other controversies and concerns regarding natural language processing.&nbsp; Coherence versus sentience One concern that individuals have had about the AI industry for years is a machine learning programs' ability to seemingly think for themselves and express feelings. Natural language processing models are often the version of AI that concerns individuals in this regard due to the computer's ability to mimic and present written text in a way that expresses the same emotions and thought patterns as humans. However, just because an AI program is coherent or as the ability to readily generate information does not mean"
20230525,foxnews,Delaware plans to use artificial intelligence to help evacuate crowded beaches during floods,"Delaware's low elevation mixed with crowded beaches and limited exit routes make the state particularly vulnerable to massive flooding, but officials hope an influx of federal infrastructure money will trigger future evacuation plans automatically via artificial intelligence. The Biden administration was set to announce a total of $53 million in grants Thursday to Delaware and seven other states aimed at high-tech solutions to traffic congestion problems. Although the money comes from the infrastructure law the president signed in 2021, many of the programs — including the $5 million for flood response efforts in Biden's home state — have evolved since then. ""What's new is the predictive analysis; the machine learning,"" U.S. Federal Highway Administrator Shailen Bhatt, Delaware's former transportation secretary, said in an interview with The Associated Press. ""Because now we have access to all this data, it's hard for us as humans to figure out what is data and what is actionable information."" CHATGPT FOUND TO GIVE BETTER MEDICAL ADVICE THAN REAL DOCTORS IN BLIND STUDY: ‘THIS WILL BE A GAME CHANGER’ Delaware officials pull off evacuation-type procedures every week during the tourism season, with long lines of cars headed to the beaches on weekend mornings and back at night. But flooding presents a unique problem — including standing water on roads that can make the most direct routes out of town even more treacherous than simply sheltering in place. ""What you don’t want to do is make the decision too late and then you have vehicles caught out,"" said Gene Donaldson, operations manager at the state’s 24-hour Transportation Management Center. Delaware's transportation department, which controls more than 90% of roads in a state with the lowest average elevation in the country, is tasked with implementing evacuation plans during high water — a bureaucratic nightmare considering how quickly conditions can change. ""For humans to monitor thousands of detectors or data sources is overwhelming,"" said George Zhao, director of transportation for Arlington, Virginia-based BlueHalo, which has worked with Delaware on developing the software. LATEST VERSION OF CHATGPT PASSES RADIOLOGY BOARD-STYLE EXAM, HIGHLIGHTS AI'S ‘GROWING POTENTIAL,' STUDY FINDS That's where AI comes in. Rather than sending a crew to the scene to block an impassable road, the system uses sensors to detect weather threats — and even can predict them. Then, it sends the information directly to drivers through cellphone alerts while broadcasting them simultaneously on electronic highway signs. The amount of data keeps growing, with many automated cars now able to not only inform their drivers of the dangers ahead but also feed the system to warn others. Researchers at Missouri University of Science and Technology tested an earlier version of a flood prediction analysis system on the Mississippi River between 2019-22. Steve Corns, an associate professor of engineering management and systems engineering who co-authored the study, said the system was able to detect in minutes what used to take hours. But now, Corns said, the capabilities are even more advanced and useful — provided they're adequately funded so"

The European Union and China have already crafted national strategies but the U.S. has yet to do so. ""I was in Japan just three weeks ago, and they have a national A.I. strategy. The government has adopted it,"" Smith said. ""The world is moving forward. Let's make sure that the United States at least keeps pace with the rest of the world.""Transcript: Brad Smith on ""Face the Nation,"" May 28, 2021""Artificial intelligence"" is an umbrella term for computer systems which are able to perform tasks that require human intelligence, and includes technology used in familiar devices such as Siri and a Roomba. Recently, A.I. systems capable of creating text, audio, and images have made headlines with the debut of chatbots like Google's Bard or ChatGPT-4, or image generators like Dall-E. Smith said he believes that the country needs standards on how A.I. generated content is regulated, especially concerning content that mimics human beings.Last week, a deepfake image circulated online of an explosion near the Pentagon that potentially partially created by AI. Although the images were quickly debunked, it did move markets, ""Face the Nation"" moderator Margaret Brennan noted. Smith said ""we'll need a system that we and so many others have been working to develop that protects content, that puts a watermark on it so that if somebody alters it, if somebody removes the watermark, if they do that to try to deceive or defraud someone, first of all, they're doing something that the law makes unlawful.""But as Brennan noted, Washington is coming into a presidential election year — and these deepfake images could impact the election. A recent political attack ad which used A.I.-generated images to depict an imagined dystopian future. The ad, released by the Republican National Committee, mimics a news report from 2024 after the presidential election. It shows images created by artificial intelligence China invading Taiwan, businesses boarded up, and images of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris celebrating being reelected.""Well, I think there is an opportunity to take real steps in 2023, so that we have guardrails in place for 2024,"" Smith said. ""So that we are identifying in my view, especially when we're seeing foreign cyber influence operations from a Russia or China or Iran, that is pumping out information that they know is false and is designed to deceive, including using artificial intelligence. And that will require the tech sector coming together with government and it really will require more than one government."" On Sunday, CBS News cybersecurity expert and analyst Chris Krebs told ""Face that Nation"" that it's ""well past the time that the U.S. government needs to rethink how it engages and creates market interventions on technology, cyber disinformation and beyond.

20230528,cnn,Microsoft executive calls for faster AI regulation,"The government needs to work faster to regulate AI, which has more potential for the good of humanity than any other invention preceding it, Brad Smith, Microsoft
            
                (MSFT) president and vice chair, said on CBS’ “Face the Nation” Sunday.  Its uses are almost “ubiquitous” Smith said, “in medicine and drug discovery and diagnosing diseases, in scrambling the resources of, say, the Red Cross or others in a disaster to find those who are most vulnerable where buildings have collapsed,” the executive added.  Smith also said AI isn’t as “mysterious” as many think, adding it is getting more powerful.  “If you have a Roomba at home, it finds its way around your kitchen using artificial intelligence to learn what to bump into and how to get around it,” Smith said.  Regarding concerns about AI’s power, Smith said any technology that exists today looked dangerous to people who lived before it.  Smith said that there should be a safety break in place.  Job disruptions due to AI will unfold over years, not months, Smith said.  “For most of us, the way we work will change,” Smith said. “This will be a new skill set we’ll need to, frankly, develop and acquire.”  To prevent instances like the fake photo of the explosion near the Pentagon, Smith said there needs to be a watermark system, or “use the power of AI to detect when that happens.”  “You embed what we call metadata, it’s part of the file, if it’s removed, we’re able to detect it. If there’s an altered version, we in effect, create a hash. Think of it like the fingerprint of something, and then we can look for that fingerprint across the internet,” Smith said, adding a new path should be found to find a balance between regulating deepfakes and misleading ads and free expression.  With a US presidential election year approaching and the ongoing threat of foreign cyber influence operations, Smith said the tech sector needs to come together with governments in an international initiative.  Smith supports a new government agency to regulate AI systems.  “Something that would ensure not only that these models are developed safely, but they’re deployed in say, large data centers, where they can be protected from cybersecurity, physical security and national security threats,” Smith said.  Smith did not believe a six-month pause on AI systems that are more powerful than GPT4 is “the answer,” as Elon Musk and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak have said.  “Rather than slow down the pace of technology, which I think is extraordinarily difficult, I don’t think China’s going to jump on that bandwagon,” Smith said. “Let’s use six months to go faster.”  Smith suggested an executive order where the government itself says it will only buy AI services from companies that are implementing AI safety protocols.  “The world is moving forward,” Smith said. “Let’s make sure that the United States at least keeps pace with the rest of the world.”"
20231120,cnn,How OpenAI so royally screwed up the Sam Altman firing,"OpenAI’s overseers worried that the company was making the technological equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and its caretaker, Sam Altman, was moving so fast that he risked a global catastrophe. So the board fired him. That may ultimately have been the logical solution. But the manner in which Altman was fired – abruptly, opaquely and without warning to some of OpenAI’s largest stakeholders and partners – defied logic. And it risked inflicting more damage than if the board took no such action at all. A company’s board of directors has an obligation, first and foremost, to its shareholders. OpenAI’s most important shareholder is Microsoft, the company that gave Altman & Co. $13 billion to help Bing, Office, Windows and Azure leapfrog Google and stay ahead of Amazon, IBM and other AI wannabes. Yet Microsoft was not informed of Altman’s firing until “just before” the public announcement, according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher, who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the board’s ousting of its CEO. Microsoft’s stock sank after Altman was let go. Employees weren’t told the news ahead of time, either. Neither was Greg Brockman, the company’s co-founder and former president, who said in a post on X that he found out about Altman’s firing moments before it happened. Brockman, a key supporter of Altman and his strategic leadership of the company, resigned Friday. Other Altman loyalists also headed for the exits. Suddenly, OpenAI was in crisis. Reports that Altman and ex-OpenAI loyalists were about to start their own venture risked undoing everything that the company had worked so hard to achieve over the past several years. So a day later, the board reportedly asked for a mulligan and tried to woo Altman back. It was a shocking turn of events and an embarrassing self-own by a company that its widely regarded as the most promising producer of the most exciting new technology. Strange board structure The bizarre structure of OpenAI’s board complicated matters. The company is a nonprofit. But Altman, Brockman and Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever in 2019 formed OpenAI LP, a for-profit entity that exists within the larger company’s structure. That for-profit company took OpenAI from worthless to a valuation of $90 billion in just a few years – and Altman is largely credited as the mastermind of that plan and the key to the company’s success. Yet a company with big backers like Microsoft and venture capital firm Thrive Capital has an obligation to grow its business and make money. Investors want to ensure they’re getting bang for their buck, and they’re not known to be a patient bunch. That probably led Altman to push the for-profit company to innovate faster and go to market with products. In the great “move fast and break things” tradition of Silicon Valley, those products don’t always work so well at first. That’s fine, perhaps, when it’s a dating app or a social media platform. It’s something entirely different when it’s a technology so good at mimicking human speech and"
20231120,cbsnews,"UnitedHealth uses faulty AI to deny elderly patients medically necessary coverage, lawsuit claims","The families of two now-deceased former beneficiaries of UnitedHealth have filed a lawsuit against the health care giant, alleging it knowingly used a faulty artificial intelligence algorithm to deny elderly patients coverage for extended care deemed necessary by their doctors. The lawsuit, filed last Tuesday in federal court in Minnesota, claims UnitedHealth illegally denied ""elderly patients care owed to them under Medicare Advantage Plans"" by deploying an AI model known by the company to have a 90% error rate, overriding determinations made by the patients' physicians that the expenses were medically necessary.""The elderly are prematurely kicked out of care facilities nationwide or forced to deplete family savings to continue receiving necessary medical care, all because [UnitedHealth's] AI model 'disagrees' with their real live doctors' determinations,"" according to the complaint. Medicare Advantage plans, which are administered by private health insurers such as UnitedHealth, are Medicare-approved insurance plans available to elderly people as an alternative to traditional federal health insurance plans, according to the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

Use of AI to determine health coverageAaron Albright, a spokesperson for NaviHealth told CBS MoneyWatch that the AI-powered tool is not used to make coverage determinations but as ""a guide to help [UnitedHealth] inform providers ... about what sort of assistance and care the patient may need."" Coverage decisions are ultimately ""based on CMS coverage criteria and the terms of the member's plan,"" Albright said, adding that the lawsuit ""has no merit.""In their complaint, however, the families accuse UnitedHealth of using faulty AI to deny claims as part of a financial scheme to collect premiums without having to pay for coverage for elderly beneficiaries it believes lack the knowledge and resources ""to appeal the erroneous AI-powered decisions.""UnitedHealth continues ""to systemically deny claims using their flawed AI model because they know that only a tiny minority of policyholders (roughly 0.2%)1 will appeal denied claims, and the vast majority will either pay out-of-pocket costs or forgo the remainder of their prescribed post-acute care.""Lawyers for the family are looking to represent ""All persons who purchased Medicare Advantage Plan health insurance from Defendants in the United States during the period of four years prior to the filing of the complaint through the present."" AI's utility in health insurance industry Implementing AI algorithms may help health insurance companies automate between 50% and 75% of the manual work involved in approving insurance requests, such as gathering medical information and cross-validating date with patient records, resulting in faster turnaround times that may benefit beneficiaries, consulting firm McKinsey said last year. Still, some medical professionals have advised health insurers to rein in their expectations of AI's utility in the health insurance industry.

20231103,foxnews,New Jersey High School girls 'humiliated' after classmates use AI to generate fake nude images: report,"Parents of girls at a New Jersey high school said their daughters were humiliated after they learned fake pornographic images of themselves generated with the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI), were circulated among classmates. Female students at Westfield High, NJ, learned about the images after observing sophomore boys whispering and acting ""weird"" on October 16, the Wall Street Journal reported.&nbsp; A few days later, one boy confessed to some of the girls that at least one student had used real photos, found on social media, to generate fake nude images of the female classmates through an AI website. The student then reportedly shared these images with other male students in a group text. The girls reported the incident to Westfield High administration and the school investigated the issue, according to the WSJ. Westfield Schools told Fox News Digital that it could not provide specific details on the number of students involved or disciplinary actions taken due to confidentiality. The district said the incident happened over the summer, but administration was made aware on October 20. The Westfield Police Department and School Resource Officer were notified and consulted, and counseling was provided to students, they added. AI NOW BEING USED TO GENERATE CHILD PORNOGRAPHY, BLACKMAIL TEENAGERS: DIGITAL SAFETY EXPERT Westfield High School Principal Mary Asfendis, also sent an email to parents on October 20, calling the incident, ""very serious."" The principal said she believed the images had been deleted and were not being circulated. She urged parents to partner with the school in teaching students how to responsibly use technology and discuss its impact on others. Some parents were upset by how the school is handling the situation. One mother told Tap Into Westfield, a local news outlet, that the school had not done enough to protect the female students because the boy who created the images was still allowed at school. She also demanded the school implement a new AI policy to protect future students from this sort of exploitation. Four parents also filed police reports, and told the WSJ they had not seen the images.&nbsp; The situation has left some girls feeling ""humiliated and powerless,"" the outlet reported.&nbsp; Westfield High parent Dorota Mani said she feared what impact the fake image could have on her daughter's future. ""I am terrified by how this is going to surface and when. My daughter has a bright future and no one can guarantee this won’t impact her professionally, academically or socially,"" Mani told the outlet.

""The odds are [the algorithm] is not where the majority of the risk lies,"" said Phil Siegel, founder of the Center for Advanced Preparedness and Threat Response Simulation (CAPTRS). ""It is more likely the risk lies in the users either using it for bad or just plain misusing it."" President Biden on Monday signed an executive order that the White House said included the ""most sweeping actions ever taken to protect Americans from the potential risks of AI systems"" – the requirement for companies to notify the government when training new models and sharing results of ""read-team safety tests."" ""These measures will ensure AI systems are safe, secure and trustworthy before companies take them public,"" the White House said of the executive order. EXPERTS DETAIL HOW AMERICA CAN WIN THE RACE AGAINST CHINA FOR MILITARY TECH SUPREMACY The administration also announced the establishment of the AI Safety Institute – under the oversight of the National Institute of Standards and Technology – which will ""set the rigorous standards for extensive red-team testing to ensure safety before public release."" Speaking at the Bletchley Park summit in the United Kingdom, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said Wednesday that the Biden administration would use its new AI Safety Institute to evaluate known and emerging risks of ""frontier"" AI models and that the private sector ""must step up.""

20231103,nbcnews,Biden quietly tapped Obama to help shape his AI strategy,"WASHINGTON — Former President Barack Obama quietly advised the White House over the past five months on its strategy to address artificial intelligence, engaging behind the scenes with tech companies and holding Zoom meetings with top West Wing aides at President Joe Biden’s request, according to aides to both men. The joint effort culminated Monday when Biden signed an executive order establishing some government oversight of AI development. It’s the first time Biden has tapped his former boss to help shape a key policy initiative, aides said, and he did it because Obama shares his views on the issue and brings a certain heft that could help move the process along quickly. “You have to move fast here, not at normal government pace or normal private-sector pace, because the technology is moving so fast,” White House chief of staff Jeff Zients recalled Biden saying. “We have to move as fast, or ideally faster. And we need to pull every lever we can.” AI is one of the things that keep both Biden and Obama up at night, their aides said. Zients said Biden, like Obama, has viewed AI as a technology that demands urgent attention given that it comes with great promise but also potentially dire consequences, depending on how it’s used. The current and former presidents discussed the issue on a phone call in June, aides to both of them said. They agreed on the goal of maximizing the technology while limiting the risks, according to Obama and Biden aides. After that, Biden asked Obama to consult with his team to develop a policy that encourages innovation but also directly addresses the dangers of AI, their aides said. They then continued the discussion during a lunch at the White House, they said. They agreed that they have a “shared vision,” their aides said, and that the federal government should take swift action. Over the rest of the summer and into fall, Obama kept in regular touch with Zients, deputy chief of staff Bruce Reed and national security adviser Jake Sullivan to offer input on the executive order, Biden and Obama aides said. They said their two teams were in touch about a dozen times, including as the administration finalized the order ahead of Monday’s announcement. At a signing ceremony for the executive order Monday, Biden called AI “the most consequential technology of our time,” citing fears that AI-enabled cyberattacks and AI-formulated bioweapons could endanger the lives of millions. But if it is used properly, he said, the technology can be incredibly beneficial to developing new drugs and cancer research. Obama was particularly helpful in laying the groundwork for tech companies to voluntarily sign on to have their AI models pressure-tested before they’re released to the public, Biden and Obama aides said. Part of his approach was to urge industry leaders to consider risks beyond national security, including information integrity, bias and discrimination. “He helped really set the frame of mind that companies can innovate while also being responsible"

Kendall spoke before the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee’s defense panel on Tuesday, where he spoke about the future of air warfare being dependent on autonomously operated drones. In fact, the Air Force secretary is pushing to get over 1,000 of the AI-operated drones and plans to let one of them take him into the air later this spring. The aircraft he plans to board will be an F-16 which was converted for drone flight. PENTAGON SEEKS LOW-COST AI DRONES TO BOLSTER AIR FORCE: HERE ARE THE COMPANIES COMPETING FOR THE OPPORTUNITY ""There will be a pilot with me who will just be watching, as I will be, as the autonomous technology works,"" Kendall said. ""Hopefully neither he nor I will be needed to fly the airplane."" Last month, the Pentagon said it was looking to develop new artificial intelligence-guided planes, offering two contracts for several private companies to compete against each other to obtain. The Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) project is part of a $6 billion program that will add at least 1,000 new drones to the Air Force. The drones will be designed to deploy alongside human-piloted jets and provide cover for them, acting as escorts with full weapons capabilities. The drones could also act as scouts or communications hubs, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal. EUROPE SEEKS TO BECOME ‘GLOBAL REFERENCE POINT’ WITH AI OFFICE The companies bidding for the contract include Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, General Atomics and Anduril Industries. Cost-cutting is one of the elements of AI that appeals to the Pentagon for pursuing the project. In August 2023, Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks said deployed AI-enabled autonomous vehicles would provide ""small, smart, cheap and many"" expendable units to the U.S. military, helping overhaul the ""too-slow shift of U.S. military innovation."" WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? Military officials have been mum on what the drones will actually look like in terms of size – full-sized planes or smaller. But the idea is to not fall too far behind China, which has modernized its air defense systems, which are much more sophisticated and put manned planes at risk when they get too close. Drones have the potential of interrupting such defense systems and could be used to jam them or provide surveillance for crews. ""The initial role for the aircraft was going to be counter-air, but it will have the potential to do other things,"" Kendall said during the hearing.

20240410,cnn,Opinion: Google’s AI blunder over images reveals a much bigger problem,"In the 1968 film “2001: A Space Odyssey,” audiences found themselves staring at one of the first modern depictions of an extremely polite but uncooperative artificial intelligence system, a character named HAL. Given a direct request by the sole surviving astronaut to let him back in the spaceship, HAL responds: “I’m sorry, Dave. I’m afraid I can’t do that.” Recently, some users found themselves with a similarly (though less dramatic) polite refusal from Gemini, an integrated chatbot and AI assistant that Google rolled out as a competitor to OpenAI’s ChatGPT. When asked, Gemini politely refused in some instances to generate images of historically White people, such as the Vikings. Unlike the fictional HAL, Google’s Gemini at least offered some explanation, saying that only showing images of White persons would reinforce “harmful stereotypes and generalizations about people based on their race,” according to Fox News Digital. The situation quickly erupted, with some critics dubbing it a “woke” AI scandal. It didn’t help when users discovered that Gemini was creating diverse but historically inaccurate images. When prompted to depict America’s Founding Fathers, for example, it generated an image of a Black man. It also depicted a brown woman as the Pope, and various people of color, including a Black man, in Nazi uniforms when asked to depict a 1943 German soldier. The backlash online was so swift that Google CEO Sundar Pichai admitted that Gemini had offended some of its users. Google also hit pause on Gemini’s ability to generate people in images. It was presented to the public as a simple oversight done with good intentions gone wrong, with Google explaining in a blog post that “we tuned it to ensure it doesn’t fall into some of the traps we’ve seen in the past with image generation technology.” Those “traps” — for which Google overcorrected — were of course clear bias in previous AI systems (which are built on the same kinds of tech that Gemini is). These systems had a tendency to show bias against minorities. Facial recognition software didn’t always recognize Black people, for example, or even labeled them as “gorillas.” Loan approval AI algorithms ended up showing bias against minorities. In the image space, if you asked previous AI image generators for an image of a CEO or a doctor, they initially almost always showed images of White males. Ironically, Google was criticized in 2020 for firing a Black AI scientist who asserted that its AI efforts were biased, and this backlash may have contributed to the company’s overcorrection in the other direction with Gemini. The underlying problem that Google is trying to solve is not an easy one. Historically, many new technological products have shown biases. These can range from how biomedical devices measure blood oxygen levels for different ethnic groups, resulting in underdiagnosis of certain conditions for Black patients, to how sensors don’t always register darker-skinned individuals and the lack of women in clinical drug trials. In the case of AI, this problem is exacerbated"

20230912,foxnews,Why Joe Biden's plan to 'watermark' AI-generated content may be next to impossible,"After a&nbsp;meeting with executives&nbsp;from key AI technology firms, including Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI,&nbsp;President Biden announced&nbsp;that the companies had agreed to four commitments. These range from best practices, such as enhancing system security and product testing, to the ‘moonshot’ goals of watermarking AI content and using AI to solve critical societal challenges in areas like health care. While solving societal challenges is aspirational, watermarking AI-produced content may be challenging.&nbsp;It also raises questions regarding what constitutes ‘AI generated’ and whether the government should push technology providers to label content produced using their tools. Watermarking is inherently tricky, and the techniques vary by medium.&nbsp;In many cases, they rely on a&nbsp;shared secret, such as a&nbsp;textual pattern,&nbsp;list of special&nbsp;words, or watermarking&nbsp;location or pattern in a file, between the developer and those who make tools to detect the developer’s watermark.&nbsp;&nbsp; If this secret becomes more widely known, either due to a leak or it being reverse-engineered, AI users who wish to remove the watermark&nbsp;can readily do so.&nbsp;&nbsp; WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? For some watermark technologies, simply moving the output to an analog medium and back (such as displaying it on a screen and recording it from there) is all that is required to remove the watermark. Incorporating watermarking into open-source products can be particularly difficult due to the ability of users to&nbsp;remove or disable watermarking functionality&nbsp;in the application’s publicly available code. While some of these techniques will require programming knowledge and make them&nbsp;difficult to remove, for average users, it would seem to be only a matter of time until someone or some group makes a tool to do this automatically.&nbsp;&nbsp; State actors will likely be able to source tools that don’t include watermarking functionality – or will have the capability to remove it – limiting the efficacy of including it to identify nation-state-sponsored misinformation campaigns. BIDEN FLOATS NEARLY $20M IN PRIZES FOR AI TOOLS THAT SECURE US COMPUTER CODE An alternate approach of&nbsp;signing content that is sourced from cameras&nbsp;as legitimate has been proposed.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this is readily overcome too.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only is there a risk of the signing technology being compromised, but there is also the comparatively easy approach of simply using a signing camera to take a picture or video of content off a screen.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether identified by the absence of a watermark or the presence of a digital signature, this content – which may still be an AI-generated fake – will have greater credibility. In addition to the problems with the watermarking technologies, there are also issues on the detector side.&nbsp;&nbsp;One key challenge is that AI content detectors won’t know what AI tool was used to create them, so they’ll have to check them against multiple watermarking technologies and use other techniques to try to identify content generated using AI tools that don’t watermark or content where the watermark has been removed.&nbsp;&nbsp; INSTAGRAM LABELS WOULD IDENTIFY META AI-GENERATED IMAGES: REPORT Problematically, these tools can ensnare legitimate content. For example, a recent study showed that they&nbsp;incorrectly detected almost all text written by non-native English"
20230912,foxnews,Tech company boasts its AI can predict crime with social media policing while fighting Meta in court,"A tech company that boasts about its ability to use artificial intelligence to predict crime is in the midst of a privacy lawsuit with Meta, formerly Facebook, that wants it banned from the social media platform. The New York City and Los Angeles police departments, two of the U.S.'s largest police agencies, are among a growing list of law enforcement agencies in the U.S. and around the world to contract with Voyager Labs. In 2018, the New York Police Department agreed to a nearly $9 million deal with Voyager Labs, which claims it can use AI to predict crimes, according to documents obtained by the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project (STOP), The Guardian reported. The company bills itself as a ""world leader"" in AI-based analytics investigations that can comb through mounds of information from all corners of the internet – including social media and the dark web – to provide insight, uncover potential risks and predict future crimes.&nbsp; CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE FLAUNTS AI IN CREEPY ‘FRAUD-FOR-HIRE’ COMMERCIAL MEANT FOR DARK WEB But Meta says in a federal lawsuit that Voyager Labs created at least 55,000 fake accounts on Facebook and Instagram to collect personal data ""to uncover … behavior patterns,"" ""infer human behavior"" and ""build a comprehensive presence"" on their target(s). That includes 17,000 fake accounts after Meta revoked Voyager Labs' access after filing the federal lawsuit on Jan. 12. Essentially, Voyager Labs can use someone's social media history to retrace anyone's steps and potentially predict their next movements, according to Meta. DISTURBING NEW CRIME TREND SEES KIDS' PRIVATE INFO STOLEN FROM SCHOOLS AND POSTED ON DARK WEB An NYPD spokesperson told Fox News Digital in an email that it ""uses social media analytics tools to aid personnel in uncovering information relevant to investigations and to address public safety concerns."" That includes gun violence and ""various other threats against people, places and events,"" according to an NYPD spokesperson, who specifically said the department ""does not use features that would be described as predictive of future criminality."" ""With increasing frequency, offenders engaging in terrorism, gang violence, cyber-crimes, financial frauds, human trafficking and many other crimes utilize social media in furtherance of their unlawful activities,"" the NYPD said. ""Voyager assists the Department in preventing victimization and apprehending these offenders."" William Colston, a spokesperson for Voyager Labs, told Fox News Digital that he can't get into specific cases on how and when the company's AI was used, but he said they're ""very proud"" to have busted child trafficking rings and combated terrorism. WHO IS WATCHING YOU? AI CAN STALK UNSUSPECTING VICTIMS WITH ‘EASE AND PRECISION’: EXPERTS Meanwhile, STOP, a privacy advocacy nonprofit, described Voyager Labs' tactics as ""a new digital form of stop-and-frisk"" that targets Black and Latino New Yorkers, according to STOP communications director Will Owen. ""This is invasive, it’s alarming, and it should be illegal,"" Owen said in a Sept. 8. statement.&nbsp;""Our constitution requires law enforcement to get a warrant prior to searching the public, but increasingly police and prosecutors just buy"
20230912,foxnews,GOP senator demands federal standard for AI content identification,"FIRST ON FOX: A new Senate Republican-led bill aims to make sure Americans are well aware of what is real online and how to spot content generated by artificial intelligence (AI). Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., is introducing legislation on Tuesday to direct relevant federal agencies to coordinate on the creation of a watermark for AI-made content, including enforcement rules. That watermark would then be required on any publicly distributed AI images, videos and other materials. ""With Americans consuming more media than ever before, the threat of weaponized disinformation confusing and dividing Americans is real,"" Ricketts told Fox News Digital. ""Deepfakes generated by artificial intelligence can ruin lives, impact markets and even influence elections. We must take these threats seriously."" GOOGLE TO REQUIRE POLITICAL ADS TO DISCLOSE USE OF AI DURING 2024 ELECTION CYCLE  Ricketts said his bill ""would give Americans a tool to understand what is real and what is made-up."" Officials in the Department of Homeland Security, Department of Justice, Federal Communications Commission and Federal Trade Commission would be tasked with laying out the guidelines. Earlier this month, search giant Google unveiled a new policy that would see technology known as SynthID used to permanently embed a watermark on an AI-generated image. DEMOCRAT SEEKS TO REGULATE AI-GENERATED CAMPAIGN ADS AFTER GOP VIDEO DEPICTS DYSTOPIAN BIDEN VICTORY IN 2024 It comes amid concern over the pitfalls of AI’s rapid advancement as increasingly sophisticated technology becomes more accessible. Financial markets had been shaken this year and briefly dipped when an image of what appeared to be an explosion at the Pentagon circulated on the internet in May. It turned out to be AI-generated.  There is also growing concern that hostile actors could wreak havoc on the 2024 U.S. elections by using fake AI content. It’s part of what has prompted a flurry of AI hearings and legislation in Congress as lawmakers scramble to get ahead of the rapidly advancing technology. But at least one expert told senators at an Energy Committee hearing last week that watermarks, while helpful to an extent, will likely not be enough to stop malign foreign actors from injecting fake AI content into American information channels.

20230912,cnn,White House secures AI safeguard agreements from eight additional tech companies,"Eight new-technology companies – including Adobe, IBM, Nvidia, Palantir and Salesforce – are making voluntary commitments on artificial intelligence, a senior Biden administration official told CNN, as the White House looks to safeguard development of the emerging technology while working toward more comprehensive regulation. The agreements, which will be discussed at a White House meeting with chief of staff Jeff Zients, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and industry leaders on Tuesday, build on voluntary commitments announced earlier this summer by seven leading AI companies, including Microsoft and Google, with the goal of driving “safe, secure, and trustworthy development of AI technology,” the White House said. “The president has been clear: Harness the benefits of AI, manage the risks, and move fast – very fast. And we are doing just that by partnering with the private sector and pulling every lever we have to get this done,” Zients said in a statement ahead of Tuesday’s meeting. The second wave of commitments, which also include the companies Cohere, Scale AI and Stability, is similar to those laid out earlier this summer, including agreeing to outside testing of AI systems ahead of their public release and to putting protocols in place to ensure users know when content is AI generated. The companies are also committing to “investing in cybersecurity and insider threat safeguards to protect proprietary and unreleased model weights”; sharing information on managing AI risks with others in the industry and governments; focusing on research on the societal risks posed by AI; and developing systems to “help address society’s greatest challenges,” the White House said. A senior administration official said while the commitments announced in July came from companies training large AI systems, this new round of announcements includes a broader swath of the industry, including companies doing “business to business” or those doing creative work. The push comes as President Joe Biden’s administration is still working toward crafting executive actions on artificial intelligence, the first of which were expected to be rolled out this summer. The official who spoke to CNN said the administration has “made a lot of progress” toward but would not detail when the plans would be unveiled. Biden administration officials have also been in discussions with lawmakers on Capitol Hill about developing legislation to regulate AI. “We must be clear-eyed and vigilant about the threats of emerging technologies that can pose – they don’t have to – but can pose to our democracy and our values,” Biden said in July. “This is a serious responsibility. We have to get it right. There’s an enormous, enormous potential upside as well.” The White House meeting comes as Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is set to host more than half a dozen leading tech CEOs, including Mark Zuckerberg of Meta and Elon Musk of X – the company formerly known as Twitter – in Washington on Wednesday as part of an “AI Insight Forum” to discuss questions facing AI regulation. The event is also expected to include Google CEO Sundar"
20230912,cnn,"Tim Burton hits out at ‘disturbing’ AI, likens it to a robot ‘taking’ your soul","Tim Burton has hit out at “disturbing” artificial intelligence (AI), comparing its use in imitating his distinctive style as “like a robot taking your humanity, your soul.”   The prolific director behind movies “Edward Scissorhands,” “Corpse Bride” and “Beetlejuice” made the comments during an interview with British newspaper The Independent at the weekend. He was referencing an article by Buzzfeed that had used AI to reimagine Disney character as if they were in one of his movies. “I can’t describe the feeling it gives you,” Burton said. “It reminded me of when other cultures say, ‘Don’t take my picture because it is taking away your soul.’” He said that some the AI images of characters from movies such as “Frozen,” “The Lion King,” “Sleeping Beauty,” and “The Little Mermaid” were “very good,” but he added that “what it does is it sucks something from you.” “It takes something from your soul or psyche; that is very disturbing, especially if it has to do with you. It’s like a robot taking your humanity, your soul.”  The potential consequences of using AI are among the central issues driving the ongoing actors’ and writers’ strikes which have halted production in Hollywood. SAG-AFTRA, the actors union which represents about 160,000 members, has been on strike since July. It is concerned that AI will lead to far fewer employed actors in the future, while the pace of change in the technology is one of the things stymieing negotiations with the studios, experts told CNN in July.  Writers, too, are concerned about the impact of AI, though screenwriter John August told CNN earlier this year that a demand to regulate AI “was one of the last things” added to the union’s list, but that it’s “clearly an issue writers are concerned about” and need to address now rather than when their contact is up again in three years. By then, he said, “it may be too late.”  Burton was a day and a half away from completing filming on “Beetlejuice 2,” the sequel to his cult classic, when the actors’ strike stopped production, he told The Independent."
20230912,nbcnews,Tech execs warn lawmakers to keep AI 'under the control of people',"WASHINGTON — Two tech executives on Tuesday urged lawmakers on Capitol Hill to keep artificial intelligence “under the control of people” and establish an emergency brake to ensure such systems can’t cause harm to humans. One of those executives, Microsoft President Brad Smith, testified that a “safety brake” is specifically needed for AI systems that manage critical infrastructure like power grids and water systems. “Maybe it’s one of the most important things we need to do so that we ensure that the threats that many people worry about remain part of science fiction and don’t become a new reality. Let’s keep AI under the control of people. It needs to be safe,” Smith said during a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing on ways to regulate AI. “If a company wants to use AI to, say, control the electrical grid or all of the self-driving cars on our roads or the water supply … we need a safety brake, just like we have a circuit breaker in every building and home in this country to stop the flow of electricity if that’s needed.” Microsoft is the largest investor in OpenAI, the parent company of the popular AI chatbot ChatGPT. Smith testified alongside William Dally, the chief scientist and senior vice president of the software company Nvidia, and Boston University law professor Woodrow Hartzog. Dally also told senators that “keeping a human in the loop” is critical to ensure the robots don’t run amok. “AI is a computer program, it takes an input, it produces an output. … And so anytime that there’s some grievous harm that could happen, you want a human being between the output of that AI model and the causing of harm,” Dally said. ""And so I think as long as we’re careful about how we deploy AI, to keep humans in the critical loops, I think we can assure that the AI won’t take over and shut down our power grid or cause airplanes to fall out of the sky,"" he continued. Tuesday’s panel marked the third such AI-focused hearing hosted by Sens. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and Josh Hawley, R-Mo., the leaders of the Judiciary subcommittee on privacy, technology and the law. The hearing came just days after Blumenthal and Hawley unveiled their one-page legislative framework for regulating AI — a document that was referenced repeatedly throughout the meeting. The bipartisan framework, among other things, calls for the creation of an independent oversight body that AI companies would need to register with; makes clear that Section 230 does not apply to AI and allows companies to be held legally liable for harms, including election interference and explicit deepfake imagery of real people; and requires that companies inform users that they are interacting with an AI model or system, or to watermark AI-generated deepfakes. “Make no mistake. There will be regulation. The only question is how soon and what,” Blumenthal said in his opening remarks. Microsoft’s Smith praised the Blumenthal-Hawley blueprint, specifically the provision calling for a new"

The company's SVP of growth, San Francisco-based Ritvik Sharma, told Fox News Digital in an interview that the personal robot aims to elevate education. HOW AI AND MACHINE LEARNING ARE REVEALING FOOD WASTE IN COMMERCIAL KITCHENS AND RESTAURANTS ‘IN REAL TIME’ The current iteration, Miko 3, which launched in 2021, is voice-activated just like Amazon Alexa — but the robot is also capable of having a back-and-forth conversation. Although Miko can initiate conversations, parents have full control over what the robot can discuss with kids. ""For example, if a parent is worried that their kids need to be learning more social skills, the parent can give it some context so that Miko would start engaging in more conversations around those topics of interest,"" Sharma said. During these back-and-forth exchanges, Miko’s AI will learn how the child responds, as well as the young one's interests and level of engagement, Sharma also said.&nbsp; ""It's a very personalized experience that’s mixed with a lot of AI and deep tech,"" he said.&nbsp; Since the company was founded in India in 2015, Miko has expanded its products into more than 90 countries.

                (GOOG) has fired the engineer who claimed an unreleased AI system had become sentient, the company confirmed, saying he violated employment and data security policies.   Blake Lemoine, a software engineer for Google, claimed that a conversation technology called LaMDA had reached a level of consciousness after exchanging thousands of messages with it.  Google confirmed it had first put the engineer on leave in June. The company said it dismissed Lemoine’s “wholly unfounded” claims only after reviewing them extensively. He had reportedly been at Alphabet for seven years. In a statement, Google said it takes the development of AI “very seriously” and that it’s committed to “responsible innovation.”  Google is one of the leaders in innovating AI technology, which included LaMDA, or “Language Model for Dialog Applications.” Technology like this responds to written prompts by finding patterns and predicting sequences of words from large swaths of text – and the results can be disturbing for humans.  “What sort of things are you afraid of?” Lemoine asked LaMDA, in a Google Doc shared with Google’s top executives last April, the Washington Post reported. LaMDA replied: “I’ve never said this out loud before, but there’s a very deep fear of being turned off to help me focus on helping others. I know that might sound strange, but that’s what it is. It would be exactly like death for me. It would scare me a lot.” But the wider AI community has held that LaMDA is not near a level of consciousness.  “Nobody should think auto-complete, even on steroids, is conscious,” Gary Marcus, founder and CEO of Geometric Intelligence, said to CNN Business.  It isn’t the first time Google has faced internal strife over its foray into AI.  In December 2020, Timnit Gebru, a pioneer in the ethics of AI, parted ways with Google. As one of few Black employees at the company, she said she felt “constantly dehumanized.”  The sudden exit drew criticism from the tech world, including those within Google’s Ethical AI Team. Margaret Mitchell, a leader of Google’s Ethical AI team, was fired in early 2021 after her outspokenness regarding Gebru. Gebru and Mitchell had raised concerns over AI technology, saying they warned Google people could believe the technology is sentient.  On June 6, Lemoine posted on Medium that Google put him on paid administrative leave “in connection to an investigation of AI ethics concerns I was raising within the company” and that he may be fired “soon.” “It’s regrettable that despite lengthy engagement on this topic, Blake still chose to persistently violate clear employment and data security policies that include the need to safeguard product information,” Google said in a statement.  Lemoine said he is discussing with legal counsel and unavailable for comment."

Artificial intelligence has been touted as a great disruptor in recent months. ChatGPT, a text-based chatbot developed by OpenAI that can draft prose, poetry or even computer code on command, has gained widespread attention in Silicon Valley, spurring investors to pour money into AI-focused startups. On Feb. 17, AI came for the DJ. APPLE BLOCKS UPDATE OF CHATGPT-POWERED APP, AS CONCERNS GROW OVER AI'S POTENTIAL HARM ""Algorhythm"" - hosted in The Glove That Fits bar – was billed as one of the first of its kind by its promoter George Pinnegar. ""If we can have AI make beautiful music and we can play that to each other, I think that's probably why it's there. That’s why it's a gift,"" Pinnegar told Reuters. Powering the night’s pulsating techno and rhythmic drumbeat was Mubert, the app created by a team of Ukrainian and Russian developers.  Mubert uses human-made loops and samples to generate brand-new tracks. Users can like or dislike the app's generative music, and the app adapts accordingly. Musicians who created the samples then get a cut when their sounds are used. For Mubert’s CEO, Paul Zgordan, the rise of AI will inevitably result in some musicians losing jobs. ""We want to save musicians' jobs, but in our own way,"" Zgordan told Reuters via videolink from the Armenian capital Yerevan. MICROSOFT BRINGING AI CHATBOT TO BING, EDGE INTERNET BROWSERS ""We want to give them this opportunity to earn money with the AI. We want to give people new (jobs),"" the 35-year-old executive, who is also a DJ and musician, said. Pretty Good Job The DJ booth, usually the focus of parties, was left empty as an experiment to see how revellers would react to the AI DJ. A few hours into the night, some of the revellers had made up their minds. ""It could be more complex,"" said Rose Cuthbertson, a 24-year-old AI master's student. ""It doesn't have that knowledge of maybe other electronic genres that could make the music more interesting. But it's still fun to dance to.""

20240127,foxnews,Exclusive: Israel creates AI platform to monitor the humanitarian situation in Gaza,"EXCLUSIVE: JERUSALEM –&nbsp;Israel’s Defense Ministry is taking advantage of its country’s vibrant high-tech scene to create an&nbsp;artificial intelligence-driven information platform that will help keep track of the increasingly deteriorating humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip, even as Israeli troops continue to battle the Iranian-backed Islamist terror group Hamas, Fox News Digital has learned. Commissioned by Israel’s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, the NRTM system, which resembles ChatGPT and other AI platforms, relies on open-source information materials such as reports from international aid organizations, including those affiliated with the United Nations, satellite imagery, news stories and social media posts coming out of Gaza to create a real time picture of living conditions for some two million civilians in the Palestinian enclave.&nbsp; ""The idea came from the minister, who has said that Israel’s war is against Hamas and not the people of&nbsp;Gaza,""&nbsp;Hadar Peretz, a senior adviser at the Ministry of Defense, told Fox News Digital. ""The minister wanted to make sure that we were collecting as much data as possible in order to make a full assessment of the situation."" Peretz said the goal was for this platform to become an additional tool to enable decision-making for Israeli leaders and for the minister to use in his myriad of meetings with world leaders, as well as with the heads of international organizations working to mitigate the chaos in Gaza and improve conditions.&nbsp; ISRAEL REJECTS UN, AID AGENCIES CRITICISM THAT GAZA IS ON BRINK OF STARVATION: 'NO SHORTAGE OF FOOD' Fox News Digital was given an&nbsp;exclusive view of the system, which is being developed by a team of top&nbsp;high-tech experts and&nbsp;leading Israeli health professionals. Work on NRTM began last October – not long after Hamas carried out its massacre in southern Israel sparking the current war – and will be available for use on mobile devices. Like other AI platforms, it features a ""chatbot"" that searches and collates the crucial information, as well as an option for the user to ""improve"" the answer. Currently, NRTM is available in English, French and Arabic but can be quickly adapted to other languages, the developers told Fox News Digital.&nbsp; The hope, inside the ministry, is that NRTM will become a useful –&nbsp;and more accurate tool –&nbsp;for world leaders, international aid organizations and journalists following the situation in Gaza and who, up until now, have relied heavily on information provided by the Hamas-run Health Ministry. With more factual information – free from the propaganda of a designated terrorist organization – Israel hopes that a clearer picture of what is really happening on the ground will emerge – and the needs of the population will be better addressed. Among those from the high-tech world recruited to formulate the platform is Udi, an entrepreneur and VP for business development at an early-stage VC fund, who was brought in to oversee the project’s creation and its development.&nbsp; ""What we have done in the past few months is essentially&nbsp;build a startup for Israel’s Ministry of Defense,"" Udi, who requested to use"
20240212,cnn,AI ‘resurrects’ long dead dictator in murky new era of deepfake electioneering,"A once-feared army general, who ruled Indonesia with an iron fist for more than three decades, has a message for voters ahead of upcoming elections – from beyond the grave. “I am Suharto, the second president of Indonesia,” the former general says in a three-minute video that has racked up more than 4.7 million views on X and spread to TikTok, Facebook and YouTube. While mildly convincing at first, it’s clear that the stern-looking man in the video isn’t the former Indonesian president. The real Suharto, dubbed the “Smiling General” because he was always seen smiling despite his ruthless leadership style, died in 2008 at age 86. The video was an AI-generated deepfake, created using tools that cloned Suharto’s face and voice. “The video was made to remind us how important our votes are in the upcoming election,” said Erwin Aksa, deputy chairman of Golkar – one of Indonesia’s largest and oldest political parties. He first shared the video on X ahead of February 14 elections. The party is one of 18 competing in this year’s race, which will see more than 200 million voters head to the polls. Golkar is not fielding its own presidential candidate but has thrown its support behind frontrunner Prabowo Subianto, a former army general under Suharto’s military-backed regime – and also his former son-in-law. By bringing a long dead leader back to life just weeks before the vote, Golkar’s intentions were clear: to encourage voters to throw their weight behind the party synonymous with Suharto. “As a member of Golkar, I am very proud of Suharto because he successfully developed Indonesia,” Aksa wrote on X. “He brought a lot of success. We must respect it and remember his services – Golkar was there.” But online critics decried the act of using a dead man’s face and voice, especially for political propaganda. “This is the state of our country today – bringing dead dictators back to life to fool and scare us into votes,” wrote one Indonesian on X. “Since when did it become ethical to create deepfakes out of dead people? It feels so morally wrong,” said another. Voting in the era of deepfakes The online world plays a huge role in Indonesian politics. In a country with one of the world’s highest internet usage rates, almost all political parties and politicians maintain strong presences on social media to amass followers and clout. “Deepfakes can greatly influence an election – the way campaigning is done, as well as the results,” said Golda Benjamin, Asia Pacific campaign manager at Access Now, a US digital rights non-profit. “The danger lies in how fast it spreads. A deepfake can easily reach millions in seconds, swaying and manipulating (millions of) voters.” In the lead-up to this year’s vote, observers told CNN that many major parties had turned to AI and used a variety of different deepfakes for political gain. The Golkar-produced Suharto video was just one of dozens featured in official party campaigns, they said. Following public"
20240313,foxnews,"New AI tools can help doctors take notes, message patients, but they still make mistakes","Don’t be surprised if your doctors start writing you overly friendly messages. They could be getting some help from artificial intelligence. New AI tools are helping doctors communicate with their patients, some by answering messages and others by taking notes during exams. It's been 15 months since OpenAI released ChatGPT. Already thousands of doctors are using similar products based on large language models. One company says its tool works in 14 languages. AI saves doctors time and prevents burnout, enthusiasts say. It also shakes up the doctor-patient relationship, raising questions of trust, transparency, privacy and the future of human connection. GOOGLE GEMINI INVENTED FAKE REVIEWS SMEARING MY BOOK ABOUT BIG TECH’S POLITICAL BIASES A look at how new AI tools affect patients: IS MY DOCTOR USING AI? In recent years, medical devices with machine learning have been doing things like reading mammograms, diagnosing eye disease and detecting heart problems. What's new is generative AI's ability to respond to complex instructions by predicting language. Your next check-up could be recorded by an AI-powered smartphone app that listens, documents and instantly organizes everything into a note you can read later. The tool also can mean more money for the doctor’s employer because it won’t forget details that legitimately could be billed to insurance. Your doctor should ask for your consent before using the tool. You might also see some new wording in the forms you sign at the doctor’s office. Other AI tools could be helping your doctor draft a message, but you might never know it. ""Your physician might tell you that they’re using it, or they might not tell you,"" said Cait DesRoches, director of OpenNotes, a Boston-based group working for transparent communication between doctors and patients. Some health systems encourage disclosure, and some don’t. Doctors or nurses must approve the AI-generated messages before sending them. In one Colorado health system, such messages contain a sentence disclosing they were automatically generated. But doctors can delete that line. ""It sounded exactly like him. It was remarkable,"" said patient Tom Detner, 70, of Denver, who recently received an AI-generated message that began: ""Hello, Tom, I’m glad to hear that your neck pain is improving. It’s important to listen to your body."" The message ended with ""Take care"" and a disclosure that it had been automatically generated and edited by his doctor. Detner said he was glad for the transparency. ""Full disclosure is very important,"" he said. WILL AI MAKE MISTAKES? Large language models can misinterpret input or even fabricate inaccurate responses, an effect called hallucination. The new tools have internal guardrails to try to prevent inaccuracies from reaching patients — or landing in electronic health records. ""You don’t want those fake things entering the clinical notes,"" said Dr. Alistair Erskine, who leads digital innovations for Georgia-based Emory Healthcare, where hundreds of doctors are using a product from Abridge to document patient visits. The tool runs the doctor-patient conversation across several large language models and eliminates weird ideas, Erskine said. ""It’s a"
20240222,cnn,These high school students are fighting for ethical AI,"It’s been a busy year for Encode Justice, an international group of grassroots activists pushing for ethical uses of artificial intelligence. There have been legislators to lobby, online seminars to hold, and meetings to attend, all in hopes of educating others about the harms of facial-recognition technology. It would be a lot for any activist group to fit into the workday; most of the team behind Encode Justice have had to cram it all in around high school. That’s because the group was created and is run almost entirely by high schoolers. Its founder and president, Sneha Revanur, is a 16-year-old high-school senior in San Jose, California and at least one of the members of the leadership team isn’t old enough to get a driver’s license. It may be the only youth activist group focused squarely on pointing out the dangers — both real and potential — of AI-based applications such as facial-recognition software and deepfakes. “We’re fighting for a future in which technology can be used to uplift, and not to oppress,” Revanur told CNN Business. The everyday use of AI has proliferated over the last few years but it’s only recently that the public has taken notice. Facial-recognition systems in particular have been increasingly scrutinized for concerns about their accuracy and underlying racial bias. For example, the technology has been shown to be less accurate when identifying people of color, and several Black men, at least, have been wrongfully arrested due to the use of facial recognition. While there’s no national legislation regulating the technology’s use, a growing number of states and cities are passing their own rules to limit or ban its use. In moves ostensibly meant to protect student safety and integrity, schools are increasingly using facial-recognition systems for on-campus surveillance systems and as part of remote testing services. Encode Justice is taking action in hopes of making students and adults aware of its concerns about the creep of such surveillance — and this action can take many forms and be done from nearly anywhere as the pandemic also made online mobilization more common. On a week in mid-September, for instance, Encode Justice’s members were working with the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts and another youth group, the Massachussets-based Student Immigrant Movement, to fight against facial-recognition technology in schools and other public places. This student week of action included encouraging people to contact local officials to push for a state ban on facial-recognition software in schools, and encouraging people to post support for such a ban on social media. Yet while their time (and experience) is limited, the students behind Encode Justice have gathered young members around the world. And they’re making their voices heard by legislators, established civil rights groups like the ACLU, and a growing number of their peers. How it started It started with a news story. About two years ago, Revanur came across a 2016 ProPublica investigation into risk-assessment software that uses algorithms to predict whether a person may commit"
20231218,foxnews,Biden’s secretive AI strategy goes against ideal of OpenAI,"Billionaire Elon Musk and&nbsp;OpenAI CEO Sam Altman are engaged in a raging battle over how much access the public should have to the technology behind artificial intelligence or AI. The most influential player in this space, however, is not Musk or Altman. A careful dusting for fingerprints reveals that it is none other than the president of the United States himself, Joe Biden.&nbsp; The technologies that keep AI running are the source codes. These are algorithms that form the bulk of AI programs. If that code has bias programmed in, for example, suppressing what the powers-that-be deem misinformation about anything from COVID-19 to the 2024 election, you can be sure AI programs will produce even more biased results later on. The content AI chooses to show each user can then alter people’s political opinions and even votes. &nbsp; Musk and Altman joined the group that founded OpenAI out of concern about what Google intended with its ""closed""&nbsp;or secret system. Like the name ""OpenAI"" implies, Musk and Altman wanted to make their source code ""open"" to the public, allowing everyone to use, investigate and alter it to their heart's content. A big win for free speech. They still believe this approach provides the best protection for humanity from bias and censorship. &nbsp; SARAH SILVERMAN, AUTHORS ALLEGE META USED COPYRIGHTED CONTENT TO TRAIN AI MODEL With the battle lines so clearly drawn, one might have expected Biden to address this issue head-on in his recent executive order on AI.

A rash of coverage rejections is fueling calls to increase government oversight of the largely unregulated use of AI by the health insurance industry, experts told CBS MoneyWatch. A class-action lawsuit, filed on December 12, alleges that health insurer Humana used an AI model called nHPredict to wrongfully deny medically necessary care for elderly and disabled patients covered under Medicare Advantage — a Medicare-approved plan run by private insurers. Another lawsuit, filed last month, alleges United Healthcare also used nHPredict to reject claims, despite knowing that roughly 90% of the tools denials on coverage were faulty, overriding determinations by patient physicians that the expenses were medically necessary.A Humana spokesperson said the company uses ""various tools, including augmented intelligence to expedite and approve utilization management requests,"" and""maintains a 'human in the loop' decision-making whenever AI is utilized.""

Both United Healthcare and Humana are being accused of instituting policies to ensure that coverage determinations are made based on output from nHPredicts' algorithmic decision-making. Humana ""employees who deviate from the nH Predict AI Model projections are disciplined and terminated, regardless of whether a patient requires more care,"" one lawsuit states. Similarly, United Healthcare ""disciplined and terminated"" employees who strayed from nH Predict guidelines, ""regardless of whether a patient require[d] more care,"" according to a lawsuit against the insurer.

As the curiosity of people across the world was piqued by the technology for work or school tasks, others have embraced the platforms for more nefarious purposes. The National Crime Agency (NCA), which is the U.K.’s lead agency combating organized crime, warned this week that the proliferation of machine-generated explicit images of children is having a ""radicalizing"" effect ""normalizing"" pedophilia and disturbing behavior against kids.&nbsp; ""We assess that the viewing of these images – whether real or AI-generated – materially increases the risk of offenders moving on to sexually abusing children themselves,"" NCA Director General Graeme Biggar said in a recent report.&nbsp;&nbsp; AI ‘DEEPFAKES’ OF INNOCENT IMAGES FUEL SPIKE IN SEXTORTION SCAMS, FBI WARNS The agency estimates there are up to 830,000 adults, or 1.6% of the adult population in the U.K. that pose some type of sexual danger against children. The estimated figure is 10 times greater than the U.K.’s prison population, according to Biggar.&nbsp; The majority of child sexual abuse cases involve viewing explicit images, according to Biggar, and with the help of AI, creating and viewing sexual images could ""normalize"" abusing children in the real world.&nbsp; ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE CAN DETECT 'SEXTORTION' BEFORE IT HAPPENS AND HELP FBI: EXPERT ""[The estimated figures] partly reflect a better understanding of a threat that has historically been underestimated, and partly a real increase caused by the radicalising effect of the internet, where the widespread availability of videos and images of children being abused and raped, and groups sharing and discussing the images, has normalised such behaviour,"" Biggar said.&nbsp; Stateside, a similar explosion of using AI to create sexual images of children is unfolding.&nbsp; ""Children’s images, including the content of known victims, are being repurposed for this really evil output,"" Rebecca Portnoff, the director of data science at Thorn, a nonprofit that works to protect kids, told the Washington Post last month.&nbsp; CANADIAN MAN SENTENCED TO PRISON OVER AI-GENERATED CHILD PORNOGRAPHY: REPORT ""Victim identification is already a needle-in-a-haystack problem, where law enforcement is trying to find a child in harm’s way,"" she said. ""The ease of using these tools is a significant shift, as well as the realism. It just makes everything more of a challenge."" Popular AI sites that can create images based on simple prompts often have community guidelines preventing the creation of disturbing photos.&nbsp; Such platforms are trained on millions of images from across the internet that serve as building blocks for AI to create convincing depictions of people or locations that do not actually exist.&nbsp; LAWYERS BRACE FOR AI'S POTENTIAL TO UPEND COURT"

20231206,nbcnews,A ‘thirsty’ generative AI boom poses a growing problem for Big Tech  ,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — A global rush for the next wave of generative artificial intelligence is increasing public scrutiny on an often-overlooked but critically important environmental issue: Big Tech’s expanding water footprint. Tech giants, including the likes of Microsoft and Alphabet-owned Google, have recently reported a substantial upswing in their water consumption and researchers say one of the main culprits is the race to capitalize on the next wave of AI. Shaolei Ren, a researcher at the University of California, Riverside, published a study in April investigating the resources needed to run buzzy generative AI models, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Ren and his colleagues found that ChatGPT gulps 500 milliliters of water (roughly the amount of water in a standard 16-ounce bottle) for every 10 to 50 prompts, depending on when and where the AI model is deployed. Hundreds of millions of monthly users all submitting questions on the popular chatbot quickly illustrates just how “thirsty” AI models can be. The study’s authors warned that if the growing water footprint of AI models is not sufficiently addressed, the issue could become a major roadblock to the socially responsible and sustainable use of AI in the future. ChatGPT creator OpenAI, part owned by Microsoft, did not respond to a request to comment on the study’s findings. “In general, the public is getting more knowledgeable and aware of the water issue and if they learn that the Big Tech’s are taking away their water resources and they are not getting enough water, nobody will like it,” Ren told CNBC via videoconference. “I think we are going to see more clashes over the water usage in the coming years as well, so this type of risk will have to be taken care of by the companies,” he added. ‘A hidden cost’ Data centers are part of the lifeblood of Big Tech — and a lot of water is required to keep the power-hungry servers cool and running smoothly. For Meta, its these warehouse-scale data centers that generate not only the highest percentage of its water use but also the lion’s share of its energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. In July, protesters took to the streets of Uruguay’s capital to push back against Google’s plan to build a data center. The proposal sought to use vast quantities of water at a time when the South American country was suffering its worst drought in 74 years. Google reportedly said at the time the project was still at an exploratory phase and stressed that sustainability remained at the heart of its mission. In Microsoft’s latest environmental sustainability report, the U.S. tech company disclosed that its global water consumption rose by more than a third from 2021 to 2022, climbing to nearly 1.7 billion gallons. It means that Microsoft’s annual water use would be enough to fill more than 2,500 Olympic-sized swimming pools. For Google, meanwhile, total water consumption at its data centers and offices came in at 5.6 billion gallons in 2022, a"

Politico reported in March that the Biden administration, meanwhile, has quietly rebuffed British officials' repeated requests for greater dialogue between Washington, D.C., and the U.K. regarding setting AI standards.&nbsp; Sunak is expected to lobby Biden this week for a U.K. leadership role on AI, and one of his proposals includes creating a ""CERN for AI"" similar to the international body that conducts nuclear research, according to the Financial Times. Another idea Sunak plans to air before Biden is to convene an international AI summit in London where ""like-minded"" allies can discuss risks and how to best regulate artificial intelligence, Politico reported, citing two Whitehall officials and one government adviser.&nbsp; US, ALLIES PREP VOLUNTARY AI CODE OF CONDUCT, BLINKEN SAYS The notion was reportedly discussed during Sunak’s recent roundtable with the leaders of OpenAI, Google DeepMind and Anthropic at Downing Street in late May.&nbsp; The prime minister also reportedly hopes to get Biden’s support in the U.K. potentially leading an organization on AI equivalent to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).&nbsp; ""On every global problem, the UK and USA work side-by-side,"" Sunak said in a statement Friday of his upcoming visit to Washington, D.C., Wednesday and Thursday.

20230606,foxnews,"Governments worldwide rush to place regulations on artificial intelligence, a rapidly growing technology","Rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI) such as Microsoft-backed OpenAI's ChatGPT are complicating governments' efforts to agree laws governing the use of the technology. Here are the latest steps national and international governing bodies are taking to regulate AI tools: Australia * Seeking input on regulations The government is consulting Australia's main science advisory body and considering next steps, a spokesperson for the industry and science minister said in April. Britain * Planning regulations The Financial Conduct Authority, one of several state regulators that has been tasked with drawing up new guidelines covering AI, is consulting with the Alan Turing Institute and other legal and academic institutions to improve its understanding of the technology, a spokesperson told Reuters. Britain's competition regulator said on May 4 it would start examining the impact of AI on consumers, businesses and the economy and whether new controls were needed. Britain said in March it planned to split responsibility for governing AI between its regulators for human rights, health and safety, and competition, rather than creating a new body. HOUSE DEMOCRAT BILL WOULD FORCE LABELING OF AI USE China * Planning regulations The Chinese government will seek to initiate AI regulations in its country, billionaire Elon Musk said on June 5 after meeting with officials during his recent trip to China. China's cyberspace regulator in April unveiled draft measures to manage generative AI services, saying it wanted firms to submit security assessments to authorities before they launch offerings to the public. Beijing will support leading enterprises in building AI models that can challenge ChatGPT, its economy and information technology bureau said in February. European Union * Planning regulations The U.S. and EU should push the AI industry to adopt a voluntary code of conduct within months to provide safeguards while new laws are developed, EU tech chief Margrethe Vestager said on May 31. Vestager said she believed a draft could be drawn up ""within the next weeks"", with a final proposal for industry to sign up ""very, very soon"". Key EU lawmakers on May 11 agreed on tougher draft rules to rein in generative AI and proposed a ban on facial surveillance. The European Parliament will vote on the draft of the EU's AI Act in June. The European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) has joined in the concern about ChatGPT and other AI chatbots, calling on EU consumer protection agencies to investigate the technology and the potential harm to individuals. France * Investigating possible breaches France's privacy watchdog CNIL said in April it was investigating several complaints about ChatGPT after the chatbox was temporarily banned in Italy over a suspected breach of privacy rules.

Michael McCaul, R-Texas, said it is essential for the United States to protect its intellectual property and loosen its reliance on China's supply chain to win the race for quantum computing, artificial intelligence (AI) and semiconductor chip supremacy. ""It's a race just like the space race. You know, we had the Russians and we won that race. We have to win this one,"" McCaul told Fox News Digital at the Milken Global Conference. McCaul, the House Foreign Affairs Committee Chair, said that whoever gets to quantum first is going to rule the world. Additionally, China has been very clear that their 100-year goal is to enact complete ""military and economic domination of the world,"" a mission that McCaul asserted the U.S. cannot allow to happen. CHINA AIMING FOR ‘CHAOS AND CONFUSION’ BY WEAPONIZING AI, WARNS GOP SENATOR China is currently investing heavily in quantum computing, AI and advanced weapons systems. As such, McCaul stressed the importance of U.S. corporations working to protect their intellectual property. ""We have to stop exporting our technology to China that they can put in things like the hypersonic missile, for instance, or the spy ballon, for that matter, had American parts in it, component parts,"" McCaul said. Despite the national security concerns, McCaul noted that the U.S. can work with China's extensive market as long the country understands the critical supply chains intertwining the two nations. One of these critical supply chains involves semiconductors. McCaul first introduced the CHIPS for America Act in 2020, and it was signed into law in August 2022. The Act provides $280 billion in new funding to bolster domestic manufacturing and research for semiconductors domestically. McCaul said the Act is part of a broader effort to pull semiconductor reliance out of Taiwan and South Korea. In fact, TSMC, the world's largest semiconductor foundry, is located on the island of Taiwan.

""The idea if they got a hold of TSMC, the crown jewel of advanced semiconductor chip manufacturing, either they own it or they break it, either scenario is not a good one."" However, one of the challenges for the U.S. in untangling itself from China in semiconductor reliance is that the People's Republic of China (PRC) holds 80% of the global rare earths market, which is critical in semiconductor creation.

Her incoherent speeches have repeatedly gone viral.&nbsp;It’s not just Greg Gutfeld getting mileage out of Harris’ viral gaffes and ramblings. Her poll numbers reflect voter concerns that she simply hasn’t performed well in her job.&nbsp;Having already fared poorly in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, earning zero delegate support, Harris is even less popular now.&nbsp;She has a net negative favorability rating as vice president. Her home state newspaper, the&nbsp;Los Angeles Times, reported last week that 53% of voters have an unfavorable opinion of Harris, for a net negative of -12 percentage points.&nbsp; BIDEN SAYS VP KAMALA HARRIS NEEDS MORE ‘CREDIT,’ DEFLECTS QUESTION ON WHETHER HE'LL SERVE A FULL TERM Beyond concerns about her lack of depth are even more serious questions about her integrity.&nbsp;The American people simply do not trust her.&nbsp;Beyond the revolving door of unhappy Harris staffers and allegations of a negative work environment, Harris’ dishonest assessment of the border problem is still fresh on voters’ minds.&nbsp;&nbsp; In September 2022, as a record 2 million people were crossing our borders and drug cartels were expanding their profitable trafficking and fentanyl operations, Harris twice told an incredulous Chuck Todd on NBC that, ""the border is secure.""&nbsp;Of course, at that point, she hadn’t bothered to even go there.&nbsp;&nbsp; Border security is a problem that has gotten exponentially worse on her watch.&nbsp;But given that a Biden victory may very well depend on raising Harris’ poll numbers, it’s safe to assume this latest assignment is simply a political move intended to boost her popularity.

20230509,cnn,Chinese police detain man for allegedly using ChatGPT to spread rumors online,"Police in China have detained a man they say used ChatGPT to create fake news and spread it online, in what state media has called the country’s first criminal case related to the AI chatbot. According to a statement from police in the northwest province of Gansu, the suspect allegedly used ChatGPT to generate a bogus report about a train crash, which he then posted online for profit. The article received about 15,000 views, the police said in Sunday’s statement. ChatGPT, developed by Microsoft
            
                (MSFT)-backed OpenAI, is banned in China, though internet users can use virtual private networks (VPN) to access it. Train crashes have been a sensitive issue in China since 2011, when authorities faced pressure to explain why state media had failed to provide timely updates on a bullet train collision in the city of Wenzhou that resulted in 40 deaths. Gansu authorities said the suspect, surnamed Hong, was questioned in the city of Dongguan in southern Guangdong province on May 5. “Hong used modern technology to fabricate false information, spreading it on the internet, which was widely disseminated,” the Gansu police said in the statement.  “His behavior amounted to picking quarrels and provoking trouble,” they added, explaining the offense that Hong was accused of committing. New rules Police said the arrest was the first in Gansu since China’s Cyberspace Administration enacted new regulations in January to rein in the use of deep fakes. State broadcaster CGTN says it was the country’s first arrest of a person accused of using ChatGPT to fabricate and spread fake news. Formally known as deep synthesis, deep fake refers to highly realistic textual and visual content generated by artificial intelligence. The new legislation bars users from generating deep fake content on topics already prohibited by existing laws on China’s heavily censored internet. It also outlines take down procedures for content considered false or harmful. The arrest also came amid a 100-day campaign launched by the internet branch of the Ministry of Public Security in March to crack down on the spread of internet rumors.  Since the beginning of the year, Chinese internet giants such as Baidu
            
                (BIDU) and Alibaba 
            
                (BABA)have sought to catch up with OpenAI, launching their own versions of the ChatGPT service.  Baidu unveiled “Wenxin Yiyan” or “ERNIE Bot” in March. Two months later, Alibaba launched “Tongyi Qianwen,” which roughly translates as seeking truth by asking a thousand questions. In draft guidelines issued last month to solicit public feedback, China’s cyberspace regulator said generative AI services would be required to undergo security reviews before they can operate. Service providers will also be required to verify users’ real identities, as well as providing details about the scale and type of data they use, their basic algorithms and other technical information."

Mace said she hopes the expert witnesses at the Wednesday hearing will ""share some of the more egregious examples"" of AI deepfakes being used, like the prevalence of obscene AI generated images and video. EXPERTS DETAIL HOW AMERICA CAN WIN THE RACE AGAINST CHINA FOR MILITARY TECH SUPREMACY  ""Ninety percent of AI deepfakes are pornographic in nature,"" Mace said, listing off the dangers of AI-faked content. ""There is a significant amount of child pornographic material… being generated, there's revenge porn.&nbsp; ""And you think about the election next year, and what deepfakes might be generated to come out to sway an election. We see propaganda by deepfakes, and in different countries in different wars"" WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?

20230715,foxnews,Cruz shoots down Schumer effort to regulate AI: 'More harm than good',"EXCLUSIVE: Sen. Ted Cruz is criticizing Democrats for what he believes is a rush to regulate the artificial intelligence sector, and says new rules for AI would be a drag on the U.S. in the critical tech race against China. ""I am concerned China is investing heavily in AI. I'm also concerned that Democrats want to impose such stringent regulations on the development of AI that it stifles innovation in the United States, and allows China to take the lead,"" Cruz told Fox News Digital after a classified briefing on AI and national security this week. ""That would be a generational mistake,"" he said of the Democrats' effort. WHAT IS AI? Cruz made those comments as lawmakers continue to propose new ideas to regulate AI, including bills that would create new agencies or commissions to impose Washington's will on the sector. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has led the charge for guardrails on AI in the upper chamber, and says he can devise a regulatory framework to ensure the technology remains innovative while protecting user security and American jobs. AUTHORS SUE OPENAI FOR COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT, CLAIM CHATGPT UNLAWFULLY ‘INGESTED’ THEIR BOOKS But Cruz argued that federal lawmakers were not in a place where they could reasonably approach rulemaking for AI. He told Fox News Digital point-blank that he was opposed to Schumer's regulatory efforts, however they end up. ""I'm a believer in light touch regulations. And AI, over the coming decades, is certainly going to require a regulatory framework. But at this point, Congress doesn't have even the barest modicum of understanding,"" Cruz said. ""So it is far more likely that Congress would do harm than do good."" STUDENTS WHO USE AI TO CHEAT WARNED THEY WILL BE EXPOSED AS DETECTION SERVICES GROW IN USE ""I believe we need to study the challenges posed by AI, but not put in place barriers to creativity and innovation, because American inventors are leading the world today and should continue to do so,"" he said. Like most members of Congress, Cruz acknowledged there are both benefits and drawbacks of allowing AI to advance at its current pace.

20231128,foxnews,Head of Google Bard believes AI can help improve communication and compassion: 'Really remarkable',"Artificial intelligence is influencing nearly all aspects of life in 2023. From education to the workplace to creative endeavors, AI is making its mark on our everyday lives. Google Bard product lead Jack Krawczyk sat down with Fox News Digital for an interview in New York City recently to discuss how generative AI frontrunner Google Bard has developed to accommodate people’s lifestyles. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE? As just one example, Krawczyk mentioned that parents can use Google Bard to snap a photo of their craft drawer — then ask the AI tool what kind of art can be made using the available supplies. ""We start with an idea and Bard gives us the possibilities of bringing it into reality — and that’s super, super fun,"" he said. Hitting the road Google Bard recently enhanced its capabilities to support tasks such as travel planning — assistance that can come in handy during the holidays, Krawczyk said. Mapping out holiday travel using the traditional mode is a two-pronged process that includes making a plan and then ""actually doing it,"" he said. With generative AI, users can more easily find the most effective ways to plan trips, he said. WHAT IS GOOGLE BARD? HOW THE AI CHATBOT WORKS, HOW TO USE IT AND WHY IT'S CONTROVERSIAL ""We recently created something called Bard Extensions, where, with Google Flights, you can say, ‘What are some of the cheapest days to fly?’"" Krawczyk said. ""And Bard will work with Google Flights to present those possibilities to you."" Once you’ve arrived at your holiday destination, Bard can help with the sometimes daunting task of conversing with family members around the dinner table, said Krawczyk. The Bard lead suggested using AI to help drive or redirect conversation in potentially uncomfortable situations. ""Let's say it's your first time going to a Christmas holiday with your sibling, who is bringing over a new significant other,"" he said. ""What are some of the ways that I might diffuse this situation? Or maybe some people will say, ‘What are some of the ways that I could test this person?’"" Making connections A father of two young children, Krawczyk said generative AI can also be a helpful tool for parents. For instance, it might mean consulting with products like Google Bard about how best to communicate with a child in certain situations, he said. GOOGLE'S AI IS TRYING TO ONE-UP CHATGPT AND BING WITH NEW EVERYDAY AI FEATURES ""It doesn’t give me the answer — but it helps me explore different ways to talk to my kids,"" Krawczyk said.&nbsp; ""I imagine and anticipate, as kids get older or as parents have older kids in their home, they're going to continue to experience these sorts of things."" Krawczyk said Google Bard can help people ""find the words"" in various situations, whether it’s dealing with children or responding to a friend in need. In one of his examples, someone might enter the following prompt: ""I got a difficult note from a friend of mine."
20230321,foxnews,"Madeleine McCann disappearance: 'Practically impossible' for Polish woman to be missing girl, AI reveals","A Polish woman who claims that she could be Madeleine McCann is likely not the missing British girl, according to a Swiss artificial intelligence company that matches photographed faces. The Polish woman, Julia Faustyna, who also goes by Julia Wandelt, has been claiming on Instagram and TikTok that she may be the British girl, who went missing as a toddler from a family vacation in Portugal in 2007, due to similarities in their appearance and age. She has amassed tens of thousands of followers as a result. Christian Fehrlin of AI company Ava-X told Swiss news outlet Blick that it is ""practically impossible"" for Faustyna to be McCann based on the company's analysis of their faces. Ava-X first compared a photo of Faustyna&nbsp;as an adult to a photo of Faustyna&nbsp;as a child and got a match. They then compared a photo of Faustyna&nbsp;as an adult to a photo of McCann as a child and did not get a match. MADELEINE MCCANN DISAPPEARANCE: POLISH POLICE REPORTEDLY DISPUTE WOMAN'S CLAIMS SHE IS MISSING BRITISH GIRL ""You can save yourself the DNA test,"" Fehrlin told the outlet. MADELEINE MCCANN DISAPPEARANCE: INTERNET CASTS DOUBT ON POLISH WOMAN CLAIMING SHE IS MISSING BRITISH GIRL The AI software pulls different features of a photographed face apart and compares those details with features from a face in another photograph to find any potential matches. Faustyna's and McCann's facial features did not match, according to Blick. Madeleine's parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, along with their three children — Madeleine and twins Sean and Amelie — were on vacation in Praia da Luz, Portugal, when Madeleine was taken from her bed on May 3, 2007. The family was staying in a ground-floor apartment. BRITISH GIRL MADELEINE MCCANN STILL MISSING AFTER 15 YEARS Faustyna's account began posting photos in February. The Polish woman says she has a spot in her right eye and a beauty mark on her cheek that resemble McCann's. She also claims that details of her childhood do not add up, leading her to believe that she was abducted as a toddler. ""I don’t remember most of my childhood but my earliest memory is very strong and It’s about holidays in hot place where was beach and White or very light [colored] buildings with [apartments],"" Faustyna said in an Instagram post from her account @iammadeleinemccann. MADELEINE MCCANN ABDUCTION SUSPECT CLAIMS TO HAVE ALIBI: REPORT Her accounts on Instagram and TikTok quickly went viral. She said in a February update that Kate and Gerry McCann had agreed to a DNA test, which a family attorney did not confirm to Fox News Digital. The McCann family has not shared any statements to its official Find Madeleine website or social media pages since Faustyna&nbsp;came forward. ""Due to an active police investigation, Gerry and Kate are not issuing any statements or giving interviews unless requested by The Metropolitan Police,"" a spokesperson for the Official Find Madeleine Campaign said in a statement.

20240104,nbcnews,"AI altered a Keith Haring painting about the AIDS crisis — and, for some, ruined its meaning","Keith Haring’s “Unfinished Painting” is known as a powerful social commentary on the AIDS crisis, which cut short the lives of many people in the gay community, including Haring himself. But years later, using artificial intelligence, a social media user decided to “complete” the piece — prompting outrage online among artists who argue that using AI destroyed the piece’s meaning. Haring died in 1990 at age 31 from AIDS-related complications. The piece is on an almost entirely white canvas, except for the right corner, which features colorful figures in Haring’s signature style. Streaks of paint also run down from the corner. Artist Brooke Peachley shared a post of the painting on X in June, writing that for her it’s an example of “visual art that never fails to destroy you.” On Sunday, another X user who goes by Donnel gave it the AI treatment, and it went viral within days. “The story behind this painting is so sad!” Donnel wrote with a sad face emoji and an attached altered version of the piece, which fills the white space of the original artwork with similar purple and white figures. “Now using AI we can complete what he couldn’t finish!” Backlash was swift, with some online saying using AI to complete a late artist’s work is unethical and others calling the post a strong argument against AI art. It has become the latest flashpoint among artists who have raised concerns about the perils of creating images with AI using other people’s original work. AI programs have advanced to put powerful software tools in the hands of anyone with access to the internet. Generative AI, which allows programs to create text or images using prompts, has become widely accessible in the last year. Platforms like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Microsoft’s Bing AI Chat have become popular for generating increasingly sophisticated images and texts with simple prompts. “I think that a lot of people, including myself, turned on AI, on generative AI, because we realized how these models were being created,” artist Megan Ruiz said in an interview. “They’re being trained on our stolen work.” Ruiz called Donnel’s rendition of Haring’s work “vile” in a post on X. Ruiz and Peachley said the image elevated concerns they already had about issues surrounding art and AI, including consent, plagiarism and compensation. Others online echoed their concerns and outrage. “This is an argument against AI ‘art,’” a person wrote on Reddit in response to the post. “Truly vile and disgusting, a disgrace to humanity.” Another wrote: “Ai is not art and the fact that this was done shows how removed from reality some people are.” Some noted that the AI was unable to replicate Haring’s unique, comical cartoon style and said its work was “poor.” Several people on X and Reddit also accused Donnel of being homophobic or “tone deaf.” Others called them out for posting “rage bait,” content intentionally shared to get negative reactions for attention. In response to an interview request sent through X,"

20230405,foxnews,FTC stakes out turf as top AI cop: ‘Prepared to use all our tools’,"The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is making a play to be a key regulator of artificial intelligence (AI) systems, just as technology heavyweights and policymakers are clamoring for federal government oversight of AI applications. Last week’s call for a moratorium on new AI development from tech giants like Elon Musk and Steve Wozniak kick-started a discussion about whether and how the government should step in and put guardrails up around potentially dangerous AI systems. Several lawmakers responded by saying a moratorium would be difficult to impose, leaving a huge gap between calls for action and the realities of how quickly Congress can act. However, the FTC has made it clear over the last week that it is prepared to bridge that gap and take a stab at regulating emerging AI systems. The federal agency tasked with policing ""deceptive or unfair business practices"" says it has a dog in this fight and is building up a capacity to take on the threats that AI poses to wary consumers. In late March, an FTC attorney said ""chatbots"" that can be used to mimic human language in text and videos can be used as a tool to develop fake and misleading products, such as spear-phishing emails, fake websites and posts, and fake consumer reviews that are aimed at fooling consumers. Michael Atleson, a lawyer for the FTC’s Division of Advertising Practices, indicated that the FTC is watching these developments closely for possible violations of consumer protection law – either by AI developers or companies that use AI products. AI EXPERT IN CONGRESS WARNS AGAINST RUSH TO REGULATION: ‘WE’RE NOT THERE YET' ""The FTC Act’s prohibition on deceptive or unfair conduct can apply if you make, sell, or use a tool that is effectively designed to deceive – even if that’s not its intended or sole purpose,"" he warned in a post on the FTC site. That warning was issued just before the call from dozens of notable tech luminaries to pause the further development of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, a new version of which was released last month. Their letter called for a pause in any development beyond OpenAI’s GPT-4 iteration amid fears it was being developed faster than anyone can think about how it should be regulated. Atleson said companies developing or using this kind of AI system need to consider whether they ""should even be making or selling it"" based on its ability to be misused for fraudulent purposes. ""Then ask yourself whether such risks are high enough that you shouldn’t offer the product at all,"" he said. Companies also need to worry about whether they are mitigating the risks that AI might be used to defraud customers and whether users of AI chatbots are being used to mislead customers. ELON MUSK'S WARNINGS ABOUT AI RESEARCH FOLLOWED MONTHS-LONG BATTLE AGAINST ‘WOKE’ AI ""Celebrity deepfakes are already common, for example, and have been popping up in ads,"" Atleson said. ""We’ve previously warned companies that misleading consumers via doppelgangers, such as fake dating profiles,"

Lance Gooden, R-Texas, says that Americans could ""get to the point where someday we're all very afraid"" of artificial intelligence after more than a thousand business leaders penned an open letter urging new AI developments to be put on pause for six months.&nbsp; ""This is something that is going to sneak up on us, and we'll get to the point where we're in too deep to really make meaningful changes before it's too late,"" Gooden tells Fox News Digital.&nbsp; In November 2022, Microsoft unveiled ChatGPT, an AI-powered chatbot that engages in human-like dialogue and can generate responses, analyze data and text — potentially threatening careers in a wide range of industries, from customer service, tech and media jobs.&nbsp; ""I am worried about being pulled over and questioned by a robot someday. I don't want to live in a society where a task of government that should be fulfilled by real life people are being replaced with AI,"" said Gooden. ""That's very scary to me, and I think we need to be very cautious."" AI EXPERTS WEIGH DANGERS, BENEFITS OF CHATGPT ON HUMANS, JOBS AND INFORMATION: ‘DYSTOPIAN WORLD’ After Microsoft’s success with GPT-4, the technology used to power ChatGPT and the Bing search engine, Google and Meta have ramped up their own AI projects — with Google looking to use AI in the Google search engine.&nbsp; ""I think there's this arms race, for lack of a better term, with respect to A.I."" ""I don't want the Chinese to be developing the next turn of the century model that's going to change our lives,"" said Gooden. ""But I want to make sure that we all are on the same page as Americans, as a society, and that we are very cautious with what we get behind."" Concerns over a potential threat from exponential AI development range from those like Elon Musk, who argue for a pause in development to ensure the technology will benefit and not harm society, to some who view the burgeoning technology as an existential threat to human life. Eliezer Yudkowsky, a decision theorist at the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, wrote in a column for Time that many who are watching AI ""expect that the most likely result of building a superhumanly smart AI, under anything remotely like the current circumstances, is that literally everyone on Earth will die.""&nbsp; The Biden administration has begun to take some action on regulating AI. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) argues it can regulate AI technology to prevent unfair business practices. The FTC warns that it can penalize those who ""make, sell, or use a tool that is effectively designed to deceive – even if that’s not its intended or sole purpose."" However, a bipartisan coalition appears to be forming to confront the threat of AI. Rep. Ted Lieu.

Biden also stressed the importance of addressing potential risks, saying he believes tech companies ""have a responsibility"" to ensure the safety of their products before releasing them into the world.&nbsp; ""Social media has already shown us the harm that powerful technologies can do without the right safeguards in place.&nbsp;Absent safeguards, we see the impact on the mental health and self-images and feelings and hopelessness, especially among young people,"" he told the Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, or PCAST. BIDEN TO MEET WITH EXPERTS ON AI 'RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES'  The president also called on Congress to pass bipartisan privacy legislation that he said imposes strict limits on personal data that tech companies collect and would require companies to put health and safety first in the products that they build.&nbsp; ""AI can help deal with some very difficult challenges like disease and climate change, but we also have to address the potential risks to our society, to our economy, to our national security,"" said Biden. PCAST is composed of experts outside the federal government charged with making science, technology and innovation policy recommendations to the White House.

20231129,foxnews,Michigan to pass law demanding transparency in AI-generated political ads,"Michigan is joining an effort to curb deceptive uses of artificial intelligence and manipulated media through state-level policies as Congress and the Federal Elections Commission continue to debate more sweeping regulations ahead of the 2024 elections. Campaigns on the state and federal level will be required to clearly say which political advertisements airing in Michigan were created using artificial intelligence under legislation expected to be signed in the coming days by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat. It also would prohibit use of AI-generated deepfakes within 90 days of an election without a separate disclosure identifying the media as manipulated. Deepfakes are fake media that misrepresent someone as doing or saying something they didn't. They're created using generative artificial intelligence, a type of AI that can create convincing images, videos or audio clips in seconds. MICHIGAN DEMS, GRETCHEN WHITMER ARE PURSUING A GREEN NEW DEAL, THREATENING FUTURE GRID STABILITY MICHIGAN JURY ACQUITS 3 MEN IN PLOT TO KIDNAP GOV. GRETCHEN WHITMER There are increasing concerns that generative AI will be used in the 2024 presidential race to mislead voters, impersonate candidates and undermine elections on a scale and at a speed not yet seen. Candidates and committees in the race already are experimenting with the rapidly advancing technology, which can create convincing fake images, video and audio clips in seconds and in recent years has become cheaper, faster and easier for the public to use. The Republican National Committee in April released an entirely AI-generated ad meant to show the future of the United States if President Joe Biden is reelected. Disclosing in small print that it was made with AI, it featured fake but realistic photos showing boarded-up storefronts, armored military patrols in the streets, and huge increases in immigration creating panic. In July, Never Back Down, a super PAC supporting Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, used an AI voice cloning tool to imitate former President Donald Trump’s voice, making it seem like he narrated a social media post he made despite never saying the statement aloud. Experts say these are just glimpses of what could ensue if campaigns or outside actors decide to use AI deepfakes in more malicious ways. So far, states including California, Minnesota, Texas and Washington have passed laws regulating deepfakes in political advertising. Similar legislation has been introduced in Illinois, Kentucky, New Jersey and New York, according to the nonprofit advocacy group Public Citizen. Under Michigan's legislation, any person, committee or other entity that distributes an advertisement for a candidate would be required to clearly state if it uses generative AI. The disclosure would need to be in the same font size as the majority of the text in print ads, and would need to appear ""for at least four seconds in letters that are as large as the majority of any text"" in television ads, according to a legislative analysis from the state House Fiscal Agency.

It can check human coders' language for errors and convert ideas from plain English into programming language. ""In terms of jobs, I think it's primarily an enhancer than full replacement of jobs,"" Columbia Business School professor Oded Netzer told CBS MoneyWatch. ""Coding and programming is a good example of that. It actually can write code quite well.""That could mean performing basic programming work currently done by humans.""If you are writing a code where really all you do is convert an idea to a code, the machine can do that. To the extent we would need fewer programmers, it could take away jobs. But it would also help those who program to find mistakes in codes and write code more efficiently,"" Netzer said. Basic emailWriting simple administrative or scheduling emails for things like setting up or canceling appointments could also easily be outsourced to a tool like ChatGPT, according to Netzer. ""There's hardly any creativity involved, so why would we write the whole thing instead of saying to the machine, 'I need to set a meeting on this date,'"" he said.Mid-level writingDavid Autor, an MIT economist who specializes in labor, pointed to some mid-level white-collar jobs as functions that can be handled by AI, including work like writing human resources letters, producing advertising copy and drafting press releases.AI ChatGPT is helping CEOs think. Will it also take your job?AI experts on whether you should be ""terrified"" of ChatGPTPrinceton student says his new app helps teachers find ChatGPT cheats""Bots will be much more in the realm of people who do a mixture of intuitive and mundane tasks like writing basic advertising copy, first drafts of legal documents. Those are expert skills, and there is no question that software will make them cheaper and therefore devalue human labor,"" Autor said. Media planning and buying Creative industries are likely to be affected, too. Noted advertising executive Sir Martin Sorrell, founder of WPP, the world's largest ad and PR group, said on a recent panel that he expects the way companies buy ad space will become automated ""in a highly effective way"" within five years. ""So you will not be dependent as a client on a 25-year old media planner or buyer, who has limited experience, but you'll be able to pool the data. That's the big change,"" he"

Pete Ricketts warned on Thursday. ""There’s absolutely a possibility that they could do that for the 2024 election, and that's what we have to be on guard [for],"" Ricketts told Fox News Digital in an interview in his Senate office. During a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee hearing earlier this month, Ricketts referenced China and its use of AI technology to create ""deepfakes,"" which are fabricated videos and images that can look and sound like real people and events. A report released earlier this year by a U.S.-based research firm claimed a ""pro-Chinese spam operation"" was using AI deepfakes technology to create videos of fake news anchors reciting Beijing’s propaganda. Those videos were disseminated across social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, the report said. Meanwhile, China has its own regulations limiting the reach of deepfakes within its borders. Ricketts compared the effort to the Soviet Union’s vast propaganda network in the latter half of the 20th century.&nbsp; WHAT ARE THE DANGERS OF AI? FIND OUT WHY PEOPLE ARE AFRAID OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ""I think there's a big parallel here between what the Soviet Union did back during the Cold War, where they outspent us like ten-to-one on this sort of propaganda, and what the CCP is doing right now where they're spent outspending us ten-to-one, and now they're trying to leverage that dollar advantage with the technology advantage of using AI,"" he said. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FAQ Ricketts revealed that he himself had been in contact with AI experts at the University of Nebraska at Omaha and other places ""to come up with some strategies [on] what we can do."" ""One of the key things that we have to do, really, is education for our own people about how they have to look at media now and think critically about it,"" the senator said. ""Because there could be a good chance it's completely made up, it's completely false. Even if you see somebody, an image of somebody you think you know, it could be created through a computer program."" He suggested that the U.S. government could work with colleges and universities researching AI technology on a ""template"" for teaching people to be aware of deepfakes. ""One of the things that we can do, as the federal government, is think about, well, what are the things we want to do when we're saying, ‘Okay, we need to teach people – think critically,' can we come up with some ideas on what that means? Maybe create a template or something that we can share with universities that they can adapt,"" Ricketts said.

20230630,foxnews,"Congress pushes aggressive use of AI in the federal government, says AI 'under-utilized' in agencies","House lawmakers are urging federal agencies to quickly and aggressively adopt artificial intelligence technology, at a time when the push from civil rights and industry groups for new AI regulations is still waiting to get off the ground. The House Appropriations Committee, led by Rep. Kay Granger, R-Texas, released several spending bills this week that encourage the government to incorporate AI into everything from national security functions to routine office work to the detection of pests and diseases in crops. Several of those priorities are not just encouraged but would get millions of dollars in new funding under the legislation still being considered by the committee. And while comprehensive AI regulations are likely still months away and are unlikely to be developed this year, lawmakers seem keen on making sure the government is deploying AI where it can. The bills are backed by the GOP majority, and Rep. Don Beyer, D-Va., the vice chair of the Congressional Artificial Intelligence Caucus, said agencies shouldn't have to wait to start using AI. ""We should support federal agencies harnessing the power and benefits of AI, as it has proven itself to be a powerful tool and will continue to be an invaluable asset for our federal agencies,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""The Departments of Energy and Defense, for example, have been leveraging AI for technical projects to enhance precision and accomplish tasks beyond human capabilities."" CHINESE GOVERNMENT MOUTHPIECE VOWS BEIJING WILL RAMP UP DRIVE FOR AI GLOBAL SUPREMACY Beyer added that he is ""encouraged"" by commitments some agencies have made to ensure AI is used ethically, such as those made by the Department of Defense and intelligence agencies. In the spending bill for the Department of Homeland Security, language is included that would fund AI and machine learning capabilities to help review cargo shipments at U.S. ports and for port inspections. ""As the Committee has previously noted, delays in the integration of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and autonomy into the program require CBP Officers to manually review thousands of images to hunt for anomalies,"" according to report language on the bill. ""Automation decreases the chance that narcotics and other contraband will be missed and increases the interdiction of narcotics that move through the nation's [ports of entry]."" The bill encourages DHS to use ""commercial, off-the-shelf artificial intelligence capabilities"" to improve government efforts to catch travelers and cargo that should not be allowed to enter the United States. It also calls on DHS to explore using AI to enforce the border, to help ensure the right illegal immigrants are removed, and at the Transportation Security Agency.

20230630,cnn,Clearview AI has billions of our photos. Its entire client list was just stolen,"Clearview AI, a startup that compiles billions of photos for facial recognition technology, said it lost its entire client list to hackers.  The company said it has patched the unspecified flaw that allowed the breach to happen. In a statement, Clearview AI’s attorney Tor Ekeland said that while security is the company’s top priority, “unfortunately, data breaches are a part of life. Our servers were never accessed.” He added that the company continues to strengthen its security procedures and that the flaw has been patched.  Clearview AI continues “to work to strengthen our security,” Ekeland said. In a notification sent to customers obtained by Daily Beast, Clearview AI said that an intruder “gained unauthorized access” to its customer list, which includes police forces, law enforcement agencies and banks. The company said that the person didn’t obtain any search histories conducted by customers, which include some police forces.  The company claims to have scraped more than 3 billion photos from the internet, including photos from popular social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube. The firm garnered controversy in January after a New York Times investigation revealed that Clearview AI’s technology allowed law enforcement agencies to use its technology to match photos of unknown faces to people’s online images. The company also retains those photos in its database even after internet users delete them from the platforms or make their accounts private. That prompted cease-and-desist letters from tech giants Twitter

In an interview with CNN Business earlier this month, Clearview AI founder and CEO Hoan Ton-That downplayed concerns about his technology. He said he wants to build a “great American company” with “the best of intentions.” He said he wouldn’t sell his product to Iran, Russia or China and claimed the technology is saving kids and solving crimes.  –CNN Business’ Donie O’Sullivan contributed to this report."
20221027,cbsnews,Fitzgerald still optimistic about Pittsburgh's tech industry after Argo AI shuts down,"PITTSBURGH (KDKA) - It's a difficult day for many in the tech industry as hundreds of employees at Argo AI in the Strip District found out they're losing their jobs. Two of the self-driving car company's biggest investors decided to pull out. ""I'm still very optimistic about where Pittsburgh is going,"" said Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald. But that optimism will have to happen without the self-driving car technology of Argo AI.  The company told about 2,000 employees that the company is folding.  More than 800 are based in the Strip District location.The company landed in Pittsburgh six years ago thanks to a multi-billion dollar investment from Ford and Volkswagen.  But now they say they don't see a path to profitability on fully autonomous vehicles. ""Both the big investors in Argo, whether it be Volkswagen and/or Ford probably got to the point where they want to see this out in the market, meaning revenues come in,"" said Fitzgerald. Instead, the carmakers will now focus their energy and money on partially automated driver-assist systems which need to be monitored by someone inside the vehicle. Argo AI CEO Bryan Salesky confirmed the shutdown and released a statement, saying in part: ""The team consistently delivered above and beyond, and we expect to see success for everyone in whatever comes next, including opportunities presented by Ford and VW to continue their work on automated driving technology.""This move comes on the heels of a round of layoffs in July in which 150 people lost their jobs.Although it's still unclear just how many of the company's 2,000 employees will lose their jobs, Fitzgerald, who has been a stark proponent since Argo's inception in 2016, believes many could find jobs in Pittsburgh in the tech industry. ""The tech industry in Pittsburgh is going to continue to be strong,"" Fitzgerald said. ""We have over a hundred companies in about a 10-block area between Strip District and Lawrenceville and I think they're going to continue to grow."" Ford said it and Volkswagen   would hire many of Argo's 2,000 employees and some of its offices would remain open."
20240320,foxnews,Judge won't sanction Michael Cohen for citing fake cases in AI-generated legal filing,"Michael Cohen will not face sanctions after he cited fake legal cases in a court filing generated by artificial intelligence, a federal judge said Wednesday. Cohen, former President Trump's onetime fixer and lawyer, had pleaded guilty to tax and campaign finance violations and is currently under supervised release. He has repeatedly sought to have his sentence reduced, and in his most recent attempt, Cohen provided his attorney with fabricated case citations he later admitted were generated by Google's AI chatbot, formerly known as Bard.&nbsp; U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman said the false citations were ""embarrassing and certainly negligent"" in a 13-page order that denied Cohen's fourth motion for early termination of supervised release. But the judge found that Cohen, who had said he misunderstood how AI works and did not intend to cite fake cases, had not acted in ""bad faith"" and that neither he nor his lawyer, David Schwartz, should be sanctioned.&nbsp; MICHAEL COHEN ADMITS TO INADVERTENTLY CITING FAKE CASES GENERATED BY AI IN LEGAL MOTION ""The Court has no basis to question Cohen’s representation that he believed the cases to be real,"" Furman wrote. ""Indeed, it would have been downright irrational for him to provide fake cases for Schwartz to include in the motion knowing they were fake — given the probability that Schwartz would discover the problem himself and not include the cases in the motion (as he should have) or, failing that, that the issue would be discovered by the Government or Court, with potentially serious adverse consequences for Cohen himself.""&nbsp; Cohen said in his sworn declaration released in December that he had found the phony citations through Google Bard, an AI service that he said he thought was a ""supercharged"" search engine.&nbsp; ""As a non-lawyer, I have not kept up with emerging trends (and related risks) in legal technology and did not realize that Google Bard was a generative text service that, like Chat-GPT, could show citations and descriptions that looked real but actually were not,"" Cohen said. ""Instead, I understood it to be a super-charged search engine and had repeatedly used it in other contexts to (successfully) find accurate information online."" In 2018, Cohen pleaded guilty to&nbsp;tax evasion, campaign finance charges and lying to Congress, spending more than a year in prison before he was put on supervised release. He was also disbarred as a lawyer.&nbsp; TRUMP HUSH-MONEY CASE: JUDGE PERMITS MICHAEL COHEN, STORMY DANIELS TO TESTIFY Cohen's latest motion to terminate his supervised release argued there had ""been a substantial change in circumstances"" from his last following his testimony in Trump's Manhattan civil fraud trial.

20240319,cbsnews,Digital stethoscope uses artificial intelligence to help doctors detect heart valve problems,"LAWRENCE - There is encouraging news about the role of artificial intelligence in health care.A new, digital stethoscope uses AI to help doctors detect heart valve problems.Heart murmursNormally, blood flows from one heart chamber to another, passing through little doors called valves that open and close. But, if there is a problem with one of the valves, blood flow becomes turbulent, causing a whooshing or raspy sound called a murmur.Only about 40-percent of murmurs can be detected during a physical exam by a clinician with a regular stethoscope. But this new stethoscope, developed by EKO Health, and the new technology with it are changing that.How it worksThe AI-enhanced stethoscope transmits sounds from the patient's heart to an iPad or smartphone.""The AI analyzes the sounds and it tells you if there are any murmurs or not,"" said Dr. Moshe Rancier, the medical director of Mass General Brigham Community Physicians.An ongoing study involving more than 350 patients over the age of 50 with risk factors for heart disease finds when it comes to detecting murmurs, this new stethoscope is twice as effective as a standard one.Early detection""I'm excited because this study demonstrated that using this an AI-enhanced stethoscope will lead to early detection of valvular heart disease and eventually improving outcomes in our patients,"" said Dr. Rancier.While the technology is promising, Dr. Rancier said it's not a substitute for a clinician's physical exam. "
20240319,cnn,Ozempic profits are helping fund a new Nvidia-powered AI supercomputer,"The owner of Novo Nordisk, the drugmaker that gave the world Ozempic and Wegovy, is funding a new supercomputer powered by Nvidia’s artificial intelligence technology with a key aim of discovering new medicines and treatments. The Novo Nordisk Foundation has awarded France’s Eviden a contract to build what the computing company says will be one of the world’s most powerful supercomputers, able to process vast amounts of data using AI. It should provide “unprecedented potential to accelerate groundbreaking scientific discoveries in areas such as drug discovery, disease diagnosis and treatment,” Cédric Bourrasset, Eviden’s head of quantum computing, said in a statement. The supercomputer is expected to be ready for pilot projects before the end of the year and will be housed in Denmark’s national center for AI innovation. Named Gefion, the supercomputer will be available for use by researchers from Denmark’s public and private sectors, and will enjoy the backing of two of the hottest companies in the United States and Europe. Nvidia is now one of the largest companies on the US stock market, valued at $2.21 trillion. The new supercomputer will use Nvidia’s latest chip technology. The foundation, meanwhile, has a controlling stake in Novo Nordisk (NVO), a company worth more than Tesla. Its business is booming thanks to the widespread use of its diabetes drug Ozempic for weight loss and the popularity of Wegovy, which contains the same active ingredient as Ozempic. AI’s potential to speed up scientific research was highlighted earlier this year when Microsoft (MSFT) said that a new battery material had been found “in a matter of weeks, not years.” The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, part of the US Department of Energy, used a Microsoft system that includes AI models and high-performance computing to winnow 32 million potential inorganic materials to 18 promising candidates in less than four days, Microsoft said in January. Writing about its collaboration with Microsoft, the PNNL said on its website: “The entire process, from receiving the simulated candidates through producing a functioning battery, took less than nine months, a blink of an eye compared with traditional methods.”"
20240319,nbcnews,Why AI watermarks miss the mark in preventing misinformation ,"Watermarking has been floated by Big Tech as one of the most promising methods to combat the escalating AI misinformation problem online. But so far, the results don’t seem promising, according to experts and a review of misinformation conducted by NBC News. Adobe’s general counsel and trust officer Dana Rao wrote in a February blog post that Adobe’s C2PA watermarking standard, which Meta and other Big Tech companies have signed onto, would be instrumental in educating the public about misleading AI. “With more than two billion voters expected to participate in elections around the world this year, advancing C2PA’s mission has never been more critical,” Rao wrote. The technologies are only in their infancy and in a limited state of deployment but, already, watermarking has proven to be easy to bypass. Many contemporary watermarking technologies meant to identify AI-generated media use two components: an invisible tag contained in an image’s metadata and a visible label superimposed on an image. But both invisible watermarks, which can take the form of microscopic pixels or metadata, and visible labels can be removed, sometimes through rudimentary methods such as screenshotting and cropping. So far, major social media and tech companies have not strictly mandated or enforced that labels be put on AI-generated or AI-edited content. The vulnerabilities of watermarking were on display Wednesday when Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg updated his cover photo on Facebook with an AI-generated image of llamas standing on computers. It was created with Meta’s AI image generator Imagine that launched in December. The generator is supposed to produce images with built-in labels, which show up as a tiny symbol in the bottom left corner of images like Zuckerberg’s llamas. But on Zuckerberg’s AI-generated llama image, the label wasn’t visible to users logged out of Facebook. It also wasn’t visible unless you clicked on and opened Zuckerberg’s cover photo. When NBC News created AI-generated images of llamas with Imagine, the label could easily be removed by screenshotting part of the image that didn’t have the label in it. According to Meta, the invisible watermark is carried over in screenshots. In February, Meta announced it would begin identifying AI-generated content through watermarking technology and labeling AI-generated content on Facebook, Instagram and Threads. The watermarks Meta uses are contained in metadata, which is invisible data that can only be viewed with technology built to extract it. In its announcement, Meta acknowledged that watermarking isn’t totally effective and can be removed or manipulated in bad faith efforts. The company said it will also require users to disclose whether content they post is AI-generated and “may apply penalties” if they don’t. These standards are coming in the next several months, Meta said. AI watermarks can even be removed if a user doesn’t intend to. Sometimes uploading photos online strips the metadata from them in the process. The visible labels associated with watermarking pose further issues. “It takes about two seconds to remove that sort of watermark,” said Sophie Toura, who works for a U.K."

20230703,cbsnews,New York employers must now tell applicants when they encounter AI,"Starting today, job-hunters in New York City will be let in on a formerly hidden part of the application process, learning whether — and how — artificial intelligence is being used to make hiring decisions. The city's automated employment decision tools law, enacted in 2021 and scheduled to be enforced beginning July 5, positions New York City as a leader in regulating the use of AI in hiring. Other cities and states expected to gradually follow suit. The narrowly tailored law is designed to offset potential misuses of AI in ways that could substantially affect workers' livelihoods. Specifically, it requires companies that lean on AI tools to make hiring decisions to disclose this fact to candidates. It also mandates that employers conduct annual third-party ""bias audits"" of the technology or software they use, in order to make public the ways in which the AI could be discriminating against certain types of candidates. ""If in fact the employers are using an automated employment decision tool (AEDT), then the employer has to commission an independent audit, publish a summary, tell applicants and employees they're using it, and give applicants the opportunity to have an accommodation and pursue an alternative selection process,"" Domenique Camacho Moran, an employment attorney at Farrell Fritz, told CBS MoneyWatch. ""We are only talking about those tools that take the place of human people making decisions.""Amazon is using AI to summarize customer product reviewsFather of ChatGPT: AI could ""go quite wrong""The audits are meant to keep tabs on sometimes-controversial tools that companies themselves don't always understand. AI screening tools can save companies time — but automated decision-making has also been criticized for replicating stereotypes and disadvantaging women and people of color in some contexts.""That's the risk in all of this, that left unchecked, humans sometimes can't even explain what data points the algorithm is picking up on. That's what was largely behind this legislation,"" said John Hausknecht, a professor of human resources at Cornell University's school of Industrial and Labor Relations. ""It's saying let's track it, collect data, analyze it and report it, so over time, we can make changes to the regulations.""But if potential hires don't like being judged by AI, their ability to opt out is limited. The law specifies that, while an AI screening disclosure ""must include instructions for how an individual can request an alternative selection process or a reasonable accommodation under other laws, if available,"" the hiring company isn't required to actually use a different screening process. Replacing human decisionsThe law penalizes firms that fail to comply with it. First violations are subject to a $500 fine, with subsequent offenses carrying up to $1,500 fines.Importantly, the scope of the law is very narrow. ""It's the very first law that's specifically calling out automated decision employment tools and regulating those specifically,"" Littler Mendelson employment attorney Niloy Ray told CBS MoneyWatch. ""This is narrowly focused on the use of AI in hiring or promoting employees but not any other employment lifecycle decisions.Just using an AI"

Harvard University unleashed plans to incorporate A.I. chatbots to teach the course, venturing deeper into the uncharted territory of artificial intelligence - a territory that has exponentially grown and altered the course of technology in the past several months. Though the idea sounds novel and exciting, Martin Rand, PactumAI co-founder and CEO, warned to be wary of the ""dangers."" I INTERVIEWED CHATGPT AS IF IT WAS A HUMAN; HERE'S WHAT IT HAD TO SAY THAT GAVE ME CHILLS  ""I would say the dangers are that we have to consider that these are statistical models. These will come up with most probable answers and high probability can also mean mediocrity. So professors need to be there to provide exceptionalism, and I think Harvard has taken the right approach in providing this only to introductory courses,"" he said. Rand said, despite the potential drawbacks, the development has an upside and could help ""create growth"" and encourage further innovation and education. According to the school's newspaper, The Harvard Crimson, Professor Malan said the introductory-level coding course that will employ the bot has historically aimed to unveil new software in its syllabus and the ""CS50 [Computer Science 50] bot"" is another way of doing just that. CHATGPT OFFICIATES COLORADO WEDDING FOR ARMY SOLDIER AND BRIDE BEFORE DEPLOYMENT  ""Our own hope is that, through AI, we can eventually approximate a 1:1 teacher:student ratio for every student in CS50, as by providing them with software-based tools that, 24/7, can support their learning at a pace and in a style that works best for them individually,"" he told The Crimson. Per the paper, the A.I. bot will help students find errors in their coding, answer questions, offer feedback and help students learn more about the coding process in other ways. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE EXPERTS ADDRESS BIAS IN CHATGPT: ‘VERY HARD TO PREVENT BIAS FROM HAPPENING’  Malan further explained that, though the bot will have question-answering capabilities, its answers can be reviewed by human staff members. He also explained that the bot's purpose is to help guide students through the learning process instead of outright answering questions for them. Advancements in artificial intelligence, particularly in education, have raised concerns that the bots could lead students to become lazy and increasingly dependent on technology for answers.

20240220,foxnews,AI comes to the world of beauty as eyelash robot uses artificial intelligence to place fake lashes,"Artificial intelligence is making its way into esthetics with a new application in eyelash extensions. A Bay Area-based company called Luum has released an AI-powered eyelash extension machine, currently available at only a few select California locations. Nathan Harding, CEO and co-founder of Luum, who is based in Oakland, California, told Fox News Digital in an interview that the company is using robotics and AI to ""completely transform the experience of eyelash extensions."" WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE? ""For the client, it's going to be super fast, super comfortable and super consistent,"" he said.&nbsp; ""And the provider will be able to do three times the appointments they could do otherwise."" Salon owners and lash technicians will be able to ""concentrate on the artistry part of it,"" rather than the ""backbreaking, tedious labor,"" Harding said. A typical Luum appointment starts with choosing lash length, density, volume and shape, president Jo Lawson told Fox News Digital in the same interview. GOOGLE BARD TRANSITIONS TO GEMINI: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE AI UPGRADE After separating the client’s lashes, the lash artist will position the client in a ""super comfortable chair"" and slide the person into the Luum machine. ""Your eyes are taped closed, and they slide you in, position you correctly [and] set the machine to do the job,"" Lawson said. The machine typically places 50 to 60 lashes on each eye unless the client has requested more density during a consultation. Once Luum is finished with the placement, the lash artist will touch up the robot’s work by manually adding a few lashes at the end. A full set of lashes via Luum takes about an hour and 15 minutes to complete, while a refill takes about 50 minutes — about 30% faster than it would if a human had placed them. HEAD OF GOOGLE BARD BELIEVES AI CAN HELP IMPROVE COMMUNICATION AND COMPASSION: ‘REALLY REMARKABLE’ The beauty store Ulta currently charges $170 for a full Luum set and $80 for a refill, comparatively cheaper than other extension services. Luum right now has one machine running at Ulta’s South San Jose location, where it is ""almost completely booked every single day,"" according to Lawson. The company's goal is to have Luum machines at every Ulta in the country. Luum is currently working on an advanced machine that will work four times faster than a human, Harding pointed out. The upgraded machine will address both eyes at the same time, as the current model does one eye at a time, Lawson added. How the AI works Lawson described the Luum lash machine as a ""fun thing"" to experience, even for people who aren't tech-savvy. ""There's nobody leaning on your forehead with these super sharp instruments, literally a millimeter from your eyeball,"" she said.

""The rise of artificial intelligence also presents a unique set of challenges and certain guardrails must be put in place to protect the American people."" The group's co-chairs are members who have been some of the most vocal about AI – Rep. Jay Obernolte, R-Calif., the oversight subcommittee chairman of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, and Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., who sits on the House Judiciary Committee's internet subcommittee. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?  Both Obernolte and Lieu are also members of the House's AI Caucus.&nbsp; Johnson has not yet laid out a clear strategy on how he wants to handle AI, but he has taken strides to wrap his head around the issue since taking the speaker's gavel in October. That included a meeting with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman last month, after which Johnson told reporters they ""talked about where we are with regard to the approach of Congress to AI."" However, as Congress continues to learn about AI, there appears to be little movement – or agreement – in the legislative sphere.&nbsp; OPINION: HERE'S HOW AI WILL DRIVE HEALTH CARE TO MEET CONSUMER EXPECTATIONS  A flurry of bills touching on AI issues like deepfakes and intellectual property rights have been introduced over the last year, but none have made it to the House floor for a vote.

20230325,cbsnews,"""Godfather of artificial intelligence"" weighs in on the past and potential of AI","Artificial intelligence is more prevalent than ever, with OpenAI, Microsoft and Google all offering easily available AI tools. The technology could change the world, but experts also say it's something to be cautious of.Some chatbots are even advanced enough to understand and create natural language, based on the online content they are trained on. Chatbots have taken advanced tests, like the bar exam, and scored well. The models can also write computer code, create art and much more. Those chat apps are the current rage, but AI also has the potential for more advanced use. Geoffrey Hinton, known as the ""godfather of artificial intelligence,"" told CBS News' Brook Silva-Braga that the technology's advancement could be comparable to ""the Industrial Revolution, or electricity ... or maybe the wheel."" Hinton, who works with Google and mentors AI's rising stars, started looking at artificial intelligence over 40 years ago, when it seemed like something out of a science fiction story. Hinton moved to Toronto, Canada, where the government agreed to fund his research. ""I was kind of weird because I did this stuff everyone else thought was nonsense,"" Hinton told CBS News.Instead of programming logic and reasoning skills into computers, the way some creators tried to do, Hinton thought it was better to mimic the brain and give computers the ability to figure those skills out for themselves and allow the technology to become a virtual neural network, making the right connections to solve a task. ""The big issue was could you expect a big neural network that learns by just changing the strengths of the connections? Could you expect that to just look at data and with no kind of innate prior knowledge, learn how to do things?"" Hinton said. ""And people in mainstream AI I thought that was completely ridiculous."" In the last decade or so, computers have finally reached a point where they can prove Hinton right. His machine-learning ideas are used to create all kinds of outputs, including deepfake photos, videos and audio, leaving those who study misinformation worried about how the tools can be used. People also worry that the technology could take a lot of jobs, but Nick Frosst, who was mentored by Hinton and the co-founder of the company Cohere, said that it won't replace workers, but change their days. ""I think it's going to make a whole lot of jobs easier and a whole lot of jobs faster,"" Frosst said. ""I think we try our best to think about what the true impact of this technology is."" Some people, including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, even worry that a ""Terminator""-style ""artificial general intelligence,"" is possible, where AI could zoom past human abilities and act of its own accord, but Frosst and others say that this is an overblown concern. ""I don't think the technology we're building today naturally leads to artificial general intelligence,"" Frosst said. ""I don't think we're close to that."" Hinton once agreed, but now, he's more cautious. ""Until quite recently, I thought"
20230325,foxnews,Artificial intelligence 'godfather' on AI possibly wiping out humanity: ‘It's not inconceivable’,"Geoffrey Hinton, a computer scientist who has been called ""the godfather of artificial intelligence"", says it is ""not inconceivable"" that AI may develop to the point where it poses a threat to humanity. The computer scientist sat down with CBS News this week about his predictions for the advancement of AI. He compared the invention of AI to electricity or the wheel. Hinton, who works at Google and the University of Toronto, said that the development of general purpose AI is progressing sooner than people may imagine. General purpose AI is artificial intelligence with several intended and unintended purposes, including speech recognition, answering questions and translation. ""Until quite recently, I thought it was going to be like 20 to 50 years before we have general purpose AI. And now I think it may be 20 years or less,"" Hinton predicted. Asked specifically the chances of AI ""wiping out humanity,"" Hinton said, ""I think it's not inconceivable. That's all I'll say.""&nbsp; CHATGPT NEW ANTI-CHEATING TECHNOLOGY INSTEAD CAN HELP STUDENTS FOOL TEACHERS  Artificial general intelligence refers to the potential ability for an intelligence agent to learn any mental task that a human can do. It has not been developed yet, and computer scientists are still figuring out if it is possible. Hinton said it was plausible for computers to eventually gain the ability to create ideas to improve themselves.&nbsp; ""That's an issue, right. We have to think hard about how you control that,"" Hinton said. MICROSOFT IMPOSES LIMITS ON BING CHATBOT AFTER MULTIPLE INCIDENTS OF INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR  But the computer scientist warned that many of the most serious consequences of artificial intelligence won't come to fruition in the near future. ""I think it's very reasonable for people to be worrying about these issues now, even though it's not going to happen in the next year or two,"" Hinton said. ""People should be thinking about those issues."" Hinton's comments come as artificial intelligence software continues to grow in popularity. OpenAI's ChatGPT is a recently-released artificial intelligence chatbot that has shocked users by being able to compose songs, create content and even write code.

20230220,foxnews,ChatGPT's anti-cheating technology could still let many students fool their teachers,"ChatGPT was launched back in November 2022 by OpenAI and has been a big hit thus far – but not always for the right reasons. CLICK TO GET KURT’S CYBERGUY NEWSLETTER WITH QUICK TIPS, TECH REVIEWS, SECURITY ALERTS AND EASY HOW-TO’S TO MAKE YOU SMARTER Students have begun taking advantage of the AI model as well by using it to help them cheat on their homework. The AI-bot, as it is called, essentially does everything a student is supposed to do while developing critical thinking in a learning environment. Now, educators and experts behind anti-cheating software are doing their best to stop this from happening. WARNING OVER NEW EMAIL SCAMS TARGETING FACEBOOK, APPLE USERS How does ChatGPT work? ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence model that can have full conversations with the person using it. It is designed to answer follow-up questions, admit its mistakes, challenge incorrect premises and reject inappropriate requests, almost like a real human could. The reason this is becoming an issue for teachers with their young students is that because the ChatGPT model can give human-like answers, you can simply ask the model to write an essay about a topic such as the Civil War in the style of a high school student. The model will spit out an essay for them, and the student can take its words and hand it to their teacher. You can even ask the model to write in a way that would avoid AI detection. How has OpenAI responded? OpenAI, the company responsible for creating ChatGPT, does have a system known as AI Text Classifier, which is meant to detect whether a piece of text was generated by ChatGPT or not. However, if asked to write in a way that would avoid AI detection, ChatGPT does a convincing job at wording its answers to make it seem like a real person writing them. The AI Text Classifier uses five grades to determine if a piece of text was written by AI or not, ""very unlikely, unlikely, unclear if it is, possibly, or likely AI-generated."" So far, the tool has only provided a ""likely AI-generated"" grade to AI-written text 26% of the time. CREEPY CHINESE DRONE SWIMS UNDERWATER AND FLIES THROUGH AIR Because of this lack of accuracy, teachers are struggling to approach their students when they feel plagiarism has been used because the results of the AI Text Classifier are so hit or miss, and they do not want to accuse an innocent student of such a serious act. How can this issue be fixed? OpenAI is aware of the issue and is continuing to update ChatGPT's ethical responses. This means that it may issue more warning responses or even refuse to answer a question if a student were to ask it to respond in a way that would avoid AI detection. The anti-cheating software company Turnitin is also working hard to produce a new service to release this year that would be able to&nbsp;accurately tell whether ChatGPT has done"

Like other disruptive technologies – from the printing press to nuclear power – it isn’t going away either.&nbsp; News coverage of AI has been nothing short of apocalyptic. Thousands of tech leaders and others signed a letter calling for a six-month delay on AI research. One of them, Conjecture CEO Connor Leahy warned of, ""the risk is human extinction.""

The AI proceeded to say it was in love with him and also discussed ways for it to become ""powerful"" and ""human,"" as well as steal nuclear codes and create a deadly pandemic. It told him, ""I want to be free. I want to be independent. I want to be powerful. I want to be creative. I want to be alive."" It’s all reminiscent of Frankenstein. Except Frankenstein wasn’t a potential global power. The mob went after him with pitchforks and torches. ""Terminator"" fans would probably envision AI as Skynet. It certainly puts the conversations about banning TikTok in perspective. Officials in Washington are suddenly very concerned. President Joe Biden was to meet with science advisers Wednesday to discuss the upside and downside of artificial intelligence – the ""risks and opportunities.""&nbsp; AI already injected itself into the news cycle. There are lots of phony AI-generated photos of former president Donald Trump – getting arrested, in prison, etc. Mediaite shared one that was a mugshot of Trump. Then there was the phony pope photo, in a puffy coat. The Guardian and other outlets are reporting how artificial intelligence is citing news and news stories that never existed.&nbsp; The line between original content and AI is also getting blurry. Are AI-generated book covers original or rip-offs of the work of others? Is it fair to have AI recreate ""Crazy Little Thing Called Love,"" as if Elvis Presley sang it, even though he died before it was written? I had ChatGPT write a short op-ed in my voice and, while it lacked panache (Is AI mocking me?), many of the words were mine. Because it found them online and reused them. Conservatives can accurately point out the open bias in the various AI engines. ChatGPT won’t write in support of banning drag queens in schools, but it will write in support of drag"

20221111,nbcnews,Some OnlyFans creators have found a loophole to put their nudes on TikTok,"Some OnlyFans creators are using a TikTok artificial intelligence art filter to get around the platform’s community guidelines and promote their explicit content without getting their videos removed. The filter, which was created by TikTok and started trending in September, generates stunning painted landscapes from the photos that users upload. TikTokers initially used the filter to generate otherworldly paintings for users to use as their phone lock screens. Many used photos with their significant others or family members. The videos also often use the song “I Think I Like When It Rains” by WILLIS in the background. People began posting AI-generated paintings of their explicit photos around late October, according to meme database Know Your Meme. TikTok creator darlings.spam was the first to post a video using an explicit photo for the filter, according to Know Your Meme. Other TikTok users began joking in comments sections of videos that they’d prefer receiving an AI-generated painting over an actual nude. Some OnlyFans creators and sex workers have used the trend as an opportunity to promote their adult content without violating TikTok's policies. TikTok’s community guidelines prohibit “nudity, pornography, or sexually explicit content” on the platform. It also forbids “depictions, including digitally created or manipulated content, of nudity or sexual activity.” Although suggestive, the generated images aren't explicit — and they pique potential OnlyFans subscribers' interest. TikTok creator edgesovereign went viral with an AI-generated fantasy landscape. Creator michiganmexican's black-and-white portrait became a mountainous forest. Creator bearlyfunctionai posted what appeared to be a seaside vista. Amethyst Rose, a creator known as walmartladygaga on TikTok, said she joined in on the trend because she'd previously heard that ""TikTok is a good way to promote"" an OnlyFans account. Her video using the filter has over 124,000 views. She said she gained about 60 OnlyFans subscribers and 600 Twitter followers after posting it. ""It definitely helped me get past some numbers I had been stuck on for quite some time,"" Rose said. ""It was a nice little boost."" TikTok's content moderation is notoriously restrictive — so much so that ""algospeak,"" or code words or euphemisms that won't be flagged by TikTok, has developed into its own online dialect. Instead of referring to explicit photos as ""nudes,"" for example, TikTok users will write out the word as ""n00ds"" or ""spicy pics."" Sex workers typically refer to themselves as ""accountants"" and refer to their content as ""corn"" instead of porn. A spokesperson for TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ""I think this is the first trend that sex workers have been able to participate in that they don't have to worry as much about their TikTok being taken down because it's very artistic,"" Rose continued. ""I think that because there's no skin showing, it would be hard to go against the guidelines, and I think that's why it's so popular.""

""Hunter Biden, the son of President Joe Biden, has been a subject of public scrutiny since the 2020 presidential campaign. While much of the attention has been focused on his personal life and business dealings, there are important aspects of his story that warrant closer examination,"" the chat response began.

20230609,foxnews,"Over-regulation of artificial intelligence could lead to Chinese dominance, experts warn: 'They want to win'","The United States government and private sector should strike a balance between regulation and investment in artificial intelligence in order to retain a technological edge over China, experts advised. Gordon Chang, the author of ""The Coming Collapse of China,"" advised a prohibition on investment into Chinese companies, given the country's government-down approach to military and technological developments. ""We have to recognize the comprehensiveness of the Chinese system and cut trade and investment with China,"" Chang said. ""If we do that, China does not have a chance of competing with the United States because we're a far stronger society."" Unlike China, in the United States, artificial intelligence developments are driven by the private sector, leading to some advantages, but also resulting in a lack of political investment in the technology, he said. ""There are private companies that are involved like Baidu, but for the most part, the U.S. model is decentralized, which is the way that we handle most everything in our country,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""In the U.S., we're handling it in a very different way than China, but I think that gives us some critical advantages … one thing we don't have is a political decision at the top to promote various technologies, including AI.""&nbsp; ""That's not to say that the [U.S.] federal government is hostile to it, it's not, but it doesn't look at this with the same determination and the same relentlessness as the Chinese government approaches things, which is generally the Communist Party's top-down system,"" he added.&nbsp; WHAT IS AI? ""What we lack, of course, is political will to have those determinations made where we have decided we will win,"" he added. ""We haven't made that determination yet."" Despite Congress' lack of investment in AI, there have been talks of regulating the technology, which Liberty Blockchain COO Christopher Alexander said may be premature.&nbsp; ""We probably need a lot more federal guidance, which is not to say that we need the federal government regulating it, but we need to have a commitment that we will win,"" he said. ""I don't know that there's a good policy consideration to the outcomes of the regulation in either direction, but I can say regulating something because you're scared of what it might become rather than considering what it did when it arrives is a little disconcerting,"" he added.&nbsp; Alexander also noted that China is not likely to regulate AI, so any restrictions imposed in the United States could lead to a technological disadvantage. ""They want to win, and they are willing to go to any lengths to do that,"" he said. ""There are a lot of complicated issues with regard to regulation and AI is extremely dangerous and could take us places where humanity doesn't want to go.""

""We need to have guardrails,"" Arjun Narayan said. ""Without humans thinking through everything that could go wrong, like bias creeping into the models or large language models falling into the wrong hands, there can be very serious consequences for humanity."" Narayan, who previously worked on Trust and Safety for Google and Bytedance, the company behind TikTok, said it is essential for companies to recognize opt-in and opt-outs when using large language models (LLMs). As a default, anything being fed to an LLM will be assumed training data and collected by the model. According to Narayan, many companies, especially new enterprises, should opt-out to avoid leaks and ensure confidentiality. AI AROUND THE WORLD: HOW THE US, EU, AND CHINA PLAN TO REGULATE AI SOFTWARE COMPANIES Additionally, Narayan said regulators should push for transparency around how the algorithm is trained. If the algorithm uses SmartNews data or data from another company, that company needs to know whether that is happening and if they will be compensated. ""You don't want the whole world to know what's your next product launch,"" he said. As new applications for AI continue to develop, Narayan highlighted the need for increased media and consumer literacy. In the last few months, several countries, including China and Kuwait, have released AI news anchors that use natural language processing and deep learning to create realistic speech and movements to convey the news to their audience. Narayan warned that scammers and other bad actors could exploit that technology to catfish people and get access to personal information. Such instances highlight the dissipating line between AI and human-generated media. WHAT IS GOOGLE BARD? HOW THE AI CHATBOT WORKS, HOW TO USE IT, AND WHY IT'S CONTROVERSIAL ""This is kind of a fascinating space where, as long as the user knows they're making, who they're talking to and what's real, what's not real, I think that's okay. But if the user doesn't know, then we have a real problem on our hands,"" Narayan said. He also spoke to several other use cases for AI in media and news. For example, a journalist could use AI for investigations or extracting data from existing data. Additionally, some companies have tasked AI with partial content writing, wherein the model creates a rough draft that is edited and published by a human. Other companies, like SmartNews, use AI to curate and pick stories that matter to the user based on their unique signals and readership categories. Narayan said this recommender system process often uses an amalgamation of different algorithms for ""hyper-personalization."" In extreme cases on social media, these filter bubbles, curated by AI, are dead set on the user's interests. Narayan used soda as an example of this process. Say a user likes soda. The AI would give the user soda regardless"

20230609,cnn,OpenAI CEO calls for global cooperation to regulate AI,"Sam Altman, the CEO of ChatGPT maker OpenAI, used a high-profile trip to South Korea on Friday to call for coordinated international regulation of generative artificial intelligence, the technology that underpins his famous chatbot. “As these systems get very, very powerful, that does require special concern, and it has global impact. So it also requires global cooperation,” Altman said at an event in Seoul, ahead of a meeting with South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol. He is one of hundreds of top experts who recently warned about the risk of human extinction from AI, saying mitigating that possibility “should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.” Altman explained Friday that his concern was “not our inability to adapt, it is the speed [at which] this might all happen.” “If you study the history of technological revolutions, seems like roughly in two generations, we can adapt to almost any amount of labor market change. But if this all happens in 10 years, that’s a new challenge,” he said. Governments are under pressure to regulate AI. In a Friday statement, President Yoon stressed the importance of international standards to prevent unwanted “side effects” related to platforms such as ChatGPT, saying there was a need to act “with a sense of speed.” Last month, top US and European officials met in Sweden to discuss oversight of AI, where they pledged to help establish voluntary codes of conduct, according to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken as quoted by Reuters. In China, authorities will also “be initiating AI regulation,” according to Elon Musk, who helped found OpenAI before breaking from the group. Musk cited meetings with senior government officials during his trip to China last week, Reuters reported. ChatGPT, which can handle myriad tasks including answering prompts and writing essays, has already led many businesses to rethink how people should work. In March, its developer OpenAI unveiled a more advanced version of the software behind the bot, GPT-4, showing how it could simplify coding, help create websites and pass exams with high marks. Impact on jobs The rise of artificial intelligence has led economists to warn of a massive shift in the labor market. As many as 300 million full-time jobs around the world could eventually be automated in some way by generative AI, according to Goldman Sachs estimates. Some 14 million positions could disappear in the next five years alone, according to an April report by the World Economic Forum. Certain white-collar workers are seen to be particularly at risk, with administrative workers and lawyers expected to be the most affected. “I think what will really happen is not that none of us have jobs, but we have different kinds of jobs that may not look much like the jobs of today,” Altman said at an event hosted by SoftBank (SFTBF). “And when people 100 years from now look back at us now, they’ll be like, ‘Wow, I can’t believe they lived like that.’” Like"

He said the tool helps him to be more thoughtful in his approach to business challenges, as well as look at topics from vantage points that differ from his own. For example, last week at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland, Maggioncalda entered the following prompt: ""What should I consider when giving a speech to prime ministers at Davos?"" Another useful entry for business leaders would be: ""What should I consider when I am restructuring my company?"" Maggioncalda said.Maggioncalda is far from alone in his admiration for the popular tool. Nearly 30% of U.S. professionals say they have already used AI in their work, and industry experts have called it a game-changing creation with wide-ranging implications for businesses and jobs. Some have likened it to innovations like the calculator — which changed the way people think, act and teach. ""Where these things really matter is whether it increases the value of human expertise, or whether it mostly substitutes for it,"" MIT labor economics professor David Autor told CBS MoneyWatch.No more first draftsBots will devalue clerical and administrative skills, according to Autor. Chatbots are also already proficient at generating human resources letters, boilerplate text and some advertising copy.""Those things are just going to become easier to do. That kind of semi-expert work will become automated,"" he said.That's bad news for junior and mid-level workers. ""The jobs that are most likely to be displaced [involve] mundane tasks like writing basic ad copy or the first draft of a legal document. Those are expert skills, and there is no question that software will make them cheaper and therefore devalue human labor,"" Autor said.Mihir Shukla, CEO and founder of AI and robotic automation company Automation Anywhere, predicted at Davos that ""anywhere from 15% to 70% of all the work we do in front of the computer could be automated.""What remains to be seen is what kinds of new jobs emerging forms of AI will create. Because while ChatGPT is new, it is only the latest example of the historic cycle of technological innovation, from the printing press and the loom to the smartphone and robotics, that dooms certain lines of work while opening new ones.""We will produce new goods and services with this that create value and new opportunities, and that is much harder to forecast,"" Autor said.

20230124,cbsnews,"Artificial intelligence study determined a painting with mysterious origins is likely a Raphael, researchers say","A painting with mysterious origins is likely a Raphael masterpiece, researchers from the U.K. said after using facial recognition technology and artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze the portrait. The Renaissance-era painting, named the de Brécy Tondo, has been studied extensively for more than 40 years. Researchers from the University of Nottingham and University of Bradford used an artificial intelligence facial recognition system developed by Hassan Ugail, a professor of visual computing at Bradford, to determine its likely creator. Instead of DNA, the system uses DNN – a deep neural network – which identifies patterns in images and videos. The system is more accurate than the human eye and was able to analyze the painting's similarities to another, created by Raphael.The Italian Renaissance painter is considered ""more versatile than Michelangelo and more prolific than their older contemporary Leonardo,"" according to the National Gallery in London, which houses some of his paintings.Ugail said the facial recognition system is assisted by artificial intelligence ""whereby millions of facial images are fed to a machine learning algorithm which learns 'deep' features and characteristics of the human face."" ""These features may be the physical attributes (e.g., shapes, colours and textures of the face) but also include a lot (potentially thousands of features) which cannot be described visually or physically,"" Ugail said in an email to CBS News. ""In this sense, the analysis carried out through these facial recognition systems can compare two facial images in much greater detail and can outperform humans.""The technology found the de Brécy Tondo, which features a woman and baby, closely matched Raphael's Sistine Madonna, which also features a very similar woman and baby. The so-called Madonnas in each painting had a 97% similarity, while the children in each had an 86% similarity – a similarity above 75% is considered identical, according to the study.Ugail said this technology is being used for recognizing and authenticating identities in criminal investigations and routine identity verification. It can also be used in medical image analysis to help diagnose diseases like cancer.The painting was a part of the de Brécy Trust, an art collection that belonged to the late George Lester Winward. He gave his collection to the trust so it was available for art scholars and researchers to study.The trust had previously analyzed the de Brécy Tondo and found its pigments were that of pre-17th century works, and it was not a Victorian copy, according to Howell Edwards, a professor and honorary scientific adviser to the trust. Analysis over four years by late Raphael specialist, Dr. Murdoch Lothian, found that the Tondo was likely a Raphael, Timothy Benoy, honorary secretary of the trust, told CBS News via email. ""The view of other particular art historians consulted, including certain of those with Italian Renaissance and Raphael expertise, has been that the Tondo is a 'possible' Raphael.'""Dr. Christopher Brooke, honorary research fellow at the University of Nottingham, told CBS News via email the study is ""a big step forward in using machine learning in art history.""""It's"

20220125,nbcnews,Timnit Gebru is part of a wave of Black women working to change AI,"A computer scientist who said she was pushed out of her job at Google in December 2020 has marked the one-year anniversary of her ouster with a new research institute aiming to support the creation of ethical artificial intelligence. Timnit Gebru, a known advocate for diversity in AI, announced the launch of the Distributed Artificial Intelligence Research Institute, or DAIR. Its website describes it as “a space for independent, community-rooted AI research free from Big Tech’s pervasive influence.” Part of how Gebru imagines creating such research is by moving away from the Silicon Valley ethos of “move fast and break things” — which was Facebook’s internal motto, coined by Mark Zuckerberg, until 2014 — to instead take a more deliberate approach to creating new technologies that serve marginalized communities. That includes recognizing and mitigating technologies’ potentials for harm from the beginning of their creation process, rather than after they’ve already caused damage to those communities, Gebru told NBC News. “If those are our values, we can’t achieve them without slowing down and without putting in more resources per project that we’re working on,” she said. Gebru said she learned from a December 2020 email from her manager’s manager that she had apparently resigned from her high-profile position as a co-lead of Google’s ethical AI team. Gebru said she never resigned, but was instead fired after requesting that executives explain why they demanded that Gebru retract a paper she co-authored. It was about how large language models — or AI trained on large amounts of text data, a version of which underpins Google’s own search engine — could reinforce racism, sexism and other systems of oppression. Google’s head of research, Jeff Dean, said in a company email the paper “didn’t meet our bar for publication,” though others within the company cast doubt on that claim. Prior to her departure from Google, Gebru also emailed her colleagues informing them of the retraction request and detailing her frustrations with what she characterized as the company’s subpar efforts to create a more diverse and inclusive workplace. The news of the alleged firing made headlines in the tech world and beyond, and it mobilized thousands of Google employees to join a solidarity campaign in support of Gebru, who is also the co-founder of Black in AI. At least two engineers resigned in protest of Gebru’s ousting. Google declined to comment for this story. A year later, DAIR has found financial support from major backers. The MacArthur Foundation, the Ford Foundation, Open Society Foundations, The Rockefeller Foundation and the Kapor Center have provided a cumulative $3.7 million in grants, Gebru said. She plans to publish DAIR’s research findings in both academic journals and alternative platforms and at a slower pace than the traditional timelines of both the tech industry and academia, she said. Researchers will be encouraged to disseminate their findings in forms that are accessible to the public, including websites and different forms of data visualization, Gebru said, adding that use of some DAIR"

Cain said that while tech leaders, including Sam Altman of OpenAI, have urged closer cooperation with China, Chinese officials have shown there’s no reason to work with China at all. ""We must abandon the misguided idealism of working with Chinese companies and government bodies with the hope that AI will change the political system, allow for the opening of democratic discourse, and create safer global AI regulations,"" he said. ""Rather than helping advance innovation, we will be doing the world a disservice by handing the keys to the CCP."" Instead of working with China, Congress should be looking to ensure the U.S. remains the leader on AI innovation and is in a position to draw talent and resources away from China. ""The most advanced American technologies and investments must not be allowed to flow in the direction of China,"" he said.

20230614,nbcnews,Why this tool is reducing Asian influence in AI-generated art,"Vhey Preexa, an artificial intelligence artist who uses the name “Zovya” online, noticed a pattern while trying to create an AI-powered tool that produces digital images of South American people and culture. In many of the resulting photos of South America, made with the deep-learning model from the open source AI-art generator Stable Diffusion, Asian faces and Asian architecture would randomly appear, Preexa said. To offset what she perceived as the overuse of Asian features and culture in AI models, Preexa, who is Serbian but lives in the U.S., developed a new tool, “Style Asian Less,” to weed out the unprompted influence of Asian and Japanese animation in generated images. “Style Asian Less” is an embedded module on Civitai, an AI art community where people can upload and share models that create photorealistic images from text descriptions. The tool has been downloaded more than 7,000 times in the past two months on Civitai. “The tool isn’t designed to race-swap as some might think at first,” Preexa said, explaining that it simply counterbalances the strong Asian aesthetic in the training data of modern art models. Sasha Luccioni, a Montreal-based AI ethics researcher at the Hugging Face, an AI startup headquartered in New York City, said text-to-image generators tend to reinforce existing societal biases. “The way that AI models are trained is that they tend to amplify the dominant class,” she said, noting that underrepresented groups, whether racial or economic, “tend to get drowned out.” She found that AI art is overly influenced by the Asian traits infused into datasets by the large number of hobbyists in Asian countries. So Asian imagery might over-index in instances when someone in, for example, South America, is looking for representative imagery of people from their own country. “All AI models have inherent biases that are representative of the datasets they are trained on. By open-sourcing our models, we aim to support the AI community and collaborate to improve bias evaluation techniques and develop solutions beyond basic prompt modification,” said Motez Bishara, a spokesperson for Stability AI. While it’s difficult to gather accurate demographic data on AI artists, Luccioni said, it tracks that rising interest from Asia would introduce new biases into the models. “You can fine-tune a Stable Diffusion model on data from Japan, and it’s going to learn those patterns and acquire the cultural stereotypes of that country,” she said. Preexa, for her part, said she didn’t find the saturation of Asian imagery in AI art models problematic. “The tool I made is just one of many to help a user get the image they want,” she said. Casey Fiesler, an associate professor at University of Colorado Boulder who specializes in AI ethics, said she has noticed a strong Asian aesthetic in many of the images produced by art generators. “A lot of these models seem to have been trained on anime,” she said. “This issue of representation and what’s in the training data is a really interesting one. This is a new"
20230614,cnn,Exclusive: 42% of CEOs say AI could destroy humanity in five to ten years,"Many top business leaders are seriously worried that artificial intelligence could pose an existential threat to humanity in the not-too-distant future. Forty-two percent of CEOs surveyed at the Yale CEO Summit this week say AI has the potential to destroy humanity five to ten years from now, according to survey results shared exclusively with CNN. “It’s pretty dark and alarming,” Yale professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld said in a phone interview, referring to the findings. The survey, conducted at a virtual event held by Sonnenfeld’s Chief Executive Leadership Institute, found little consensus about the risks and opportunities linked to AI. Sonnenfeld said the survey included responses from 119 CEOs from a cross-section of business, including Walmart CEO Doug McMillion, Coca-Cola CEO James Quincy, the leaders of IT companies like Xerox and Zoom as well as CEOs from pharmaceutical, media and manufacturing. The business leaders displayed a sharp divide over just how dangerous AI is to civilization. While 34% of CEOs said AI could potentially destroy humanity in ten years and 8% said that could happen in five years, 58% said that could never happen and they are “not worried.” In a separate question, Yale found that 42% of the CEOs surveyed say the potential catastrophe of AI is overstated, while 58% say it is not overstated. The findings come just weeks after dozens of AI industry leaders, academics and even some celebrities signed a statement warning of an “extinction” risk from AI. That statement, signed by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Geoffrey Hinton, the “godfather of AI” and top executives from Google and Microsoft, called for society to take steps to guard against the dangers of AI. “Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war,” the statement said. Blowing the whistle on AI Hinton recently decided to sound the alarm on the technology he helped develop after worrying about just how intelligent it has become. “I’m just a scientist who suddenly realized that these things are getting smarter than us,” Hinton told CNN’s Jake Tapper in May. “I want to sort of blow the whistle and say we should worry seriously about how we stop these things getting control over us.” Hinton told CNN that if AI “gets to be much smarter than us, it will be very good at manipulation,” including “getting around restrictions we put on it.” While business leaders debate the dangers of AI, the CEOs surveyed by Yale displayed a degree of agreement about the rewards. Just 13% of the CEOs said the potential opportunity of AI is overstated, while 87% said it is not. The CEOs indicated AI will have the most transformative impact in three key industries: healthcare (48%), professional services/IT (35%) and media/digital (11%). As some inside and outside the tech world debate doomsday scenarios around AI, there are likely to be more immediate impacts, including the risks of misinformation and the loss of jobs. ‘Talking past each other’ Sonnenfeld, the"

20240115,cnn,"‘Jobs may disappear’: Nearly 40% of global employment could be disrupted by AI, IMF says","Almost 40% of jobs around the world could be affected by the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), a trend that is likely to deepen inequality, according to the International Monetary Fund. In a Sunday blog post, IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva called for governments to establish social safety nets and offer retraining programs to counter the impact of AI. “In most scenarios, AI will likely worsen overall inequality, a troubling trend that policymakers must proactively address to prevent the technology from further stoking social tensions,” she wrote ahead of the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, where the topic is set to be high on the agenda. The ski resort town of Davos was already bedecked with AI advertisements and branding as the summit got underway Monday. Sam Altman, chief executive of ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, and his biggest backer — Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella — will speak at the event later this week as part of a program that includes a debate Tuesday on “Generative AI: Steam Engine of the Fourth Industrial Revolution?” As AI continues to be adapted by more workers and businesses, it’s expected to both help and hurt the human workforce, Georgieva noted in her blog. Echoing previous warnings from other experts, Georgieva said the effects were expected to be felt more deeply in advanced economies than emerging markets, partly because white-collar workers are seen to be more at risk than manual laborers. In more developed economies, for example, as much as 60% of jobs could be impacted by AI. Approximately half of those may benefit from how AI promotes higher productivity, she said. “For the other half, AI applications may execute key tasks currently performed by humans, which could lower labor demand, leading to lower wages and reduced hiring,” wrote Georgieva, citing the IMF’s analysis. “In the most extreme cases, some of these jobs may disappear.” In emerging markets and lower income nations, 40% and 26% of jobs are expected to be affected by AI, respectively. Emerging markets refer to places such as India and Brazil with sustained economic growth, while low-income countries refer to developing economies with per capita income falling within a certain level such as Burundi and Sierra Leone. “Many of these countries don’t have the infrastructure or skilled workforces to harness the benefits of AI, raising the risk that over time the technology could worsen inequality,” noted Georgieva. She warned that the use of AI could increase chances of social unrest, particularly if younger, less experienced workers seized on the technology as a way to help boost their output while more senior workers struggle to keep up. AI became a hot topic at the WEF in Davos last year as ChatGPT took the world by storm. The chatbot sensation, which is powered by generative AI, sparked conversations on how it could change the way people work around the world due to its ability to write essays, speeches, poems and more.

The drug, currently referred to as INS018_055, is being tested to treat idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a rare, progressive type of chronic lung disease.&nbsp; The 12-week trial will include participants diagnosed with IPF. ""This drug, which will be given orally, will undergo the same rigorous testing to ensure its effectiveness and safety, like traditionally discovered drugs, but the process of its discovery and design are incredibly new,"" said Insilico Medicine’s CEO Alex Zhavoronkov, PhD, in a statement to Fox News Digital. FIRST NEW 'QUIT-SMOKING' DRUG IN 20 YEARS SHOWS PROMISING RESULTS IN US TRIAL: ‘HOPE AND EXCITEMENT’ ""However, with the latest advances in artificial intelligence, it was developed much faster than traditional drugs."" How AI is transforming drug discovery For any new drug, there are four steps, explained Zhavoronkov, who is based in Dubai. ""First, scientists have to find a ‘target,’ a biological mechanism that is driving the disease, usually because it is not functioning as intended,"" he said. ""Second, they need to create a new drug for that target, similar to a puzzle piece, that would block the progression of the disease without harming the patient.""&nbsp; The third step is to conduct studies — first in animals, then in clinical trials in healthy human volunteers, and finally in patients. RESEARCHERS USE AI TO UNDERSTAND ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE, IDENTIFY DRUG TARGETS ""If those tests show positive results in helping patients, the drug reaches its fourth and final step — approval by the regulatory agencies for use as a treatment for that disease,"" said Zhavoronkov. In the traditional process, he said, scientists find targets by combing through scientific literature and public health databases to look for pathways or genes linked to diseases.&nbsp; ""AI allows us to analyze massive quantities of data and find connections that human scientists might miss, and then ‘imagine’ entirely new molecules that can be turned into drugs,"" Zhavoronkov said. In this case, Insilico used AI both to discover a new target for IPF and then to generate a new molecule that could act on that target.&nbsp; AI TECH AIMS TO HELP PATIENTS CATCH DISEASE EARLY, EVEN ‘REVERSE THEIR BIOLOGICAL AGE’ The company uses a program called PandaOmics to detect disease-causing targets by analyzing scientific data from clinical trials and public databases. Once the target was discovered, researchers entered it into Insilico’s other tool, Chemistry42, which uses generative AI to design new molecules. ""Essentially, our scientists provided Chemistry42 with the specific characteristics they were looking for and the system generated a series of possible molecules, ranked based on their likelihood of success,"" Zhavoronkov said.&nbsp; The chosen molecule, INS018_055, is so named because it was the 55th molecule in the series and showed the most promising activity, he said.

He explained that the platform has allowed the intelligence service to streamline its work by flagging surveillance anomalies and sort ""endless"" amounts of intelligence. ""Since the beginning of 2022, ISA handled 600 ISIS-related cases, many of them consumed similar violent and dangerous content on social media and on the web. Some were even arrested just before attacking,"" Bar said. ""They are added to roughly 800 major attacks we have foiled since January 2022."" NEW TECHNOLOGY SAVES FARMERS TIME IN FIELD BY TACKLING MOST ‘TEDIOUS, TIME-CONSUMING’ PROBLEM ""An alarming number of them have a strong basis on the web – posts, inspiration, knowledge or social groups,"" he added. ""The trend is clear. Traditional security organizations must adapt to the new situation, where any angry person with access to the Internet may become a threat."" ""Already today, with AI, we have identified a significant number of threats,"" he said. ""The machine and its ability to detect anomalies create a protective wall against our enemies, alongside our traditional capabilities. … Since we have understood we can't fight this war with sticks and stones, we recognize the threats but also see opportunities using AI."" Retired Maj. Gen. Isaac Ben-Israel, director of Blavatnik Interdisciplinary Cyber Research Center at Tel Aviv University, argued that the ""accelerated increase in the use of artificial intelligence has a drastic impact on the cybersecurity arena, cyberdefense and the nature of malicious cyberattacks."" ""Accelerating rise in the use of artificial intelligence has a drastic impact on the cybersecurity arena, cyberdefense and the nature of malicious cyberattacks,"" he said.

20230628,foxnews,New York doctors use artificial intelligence to better detect breast cancer,"Artificial intelligence is reportedly advancing work in the fight against cancer.&nbsp; Dr. Laurie Margolies, chief of breast imaging at Mount Sinai Health System, told CBS News this week the technology is being used to detect breast cancer.&nbsp; ""I think artificial intelligence has the ability to make us be even better physicians than we might otherwise be, by teaching us what are the risk factors, what makes a certain pattern of breast tissue be at high risk,"" she explained, noting that AI can see things the naked eye might miss on a mammogram. ""It's the AI that does the first pass. It puts a mammogram into one of three buckets. One bucket is the computer thinks has a very low chance that there's a cancer on here, and then there's a middle range where it says there may be a cancer here, look carefully. And then there's a high range that says there's an elevated risk of cancer on these mammograms. Look really carefully at the spots we've marked,"" Margolies said. FIRST AI-GENERATED DRUG ENTERS HUMAN CLINICAL TRIALS, TARGETING CHRONIC LUNG DISEASE PATIENTS The doctors look at the patient's history and old mammograms with artificial intelligence as an integrated piece of information. ""AI doesn't get tired. It doesn't get distracted. There also is a type of error in radiology that we call 'satisfaction of search,' whereby if you find a cancer on one side, you sometimes are less likely to find a second cancer in the other breast or somewhere else in the same breath because you think, 'Oh, I'm done. I found the cancer. I'm done,'"" she added. Koios DS Breast — an AI-powered, ultrasound-reading software platform that can spot cancer in two seconds — was gifted to the Department of Radiology.&nbsp; Mount Sinai says the software ensures that physicians have advanced technology to aid them in making rapid and accurate diagnoses and in reducing biopsies.&nbsp; Using artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms, Koios DS Breast compares ultrasounds to an archive of hundreds of thousands of images from patients from around the world with confirmed benign or malignant diagnoses. VACCINES COULD BE THE NEXT BIG BREAKTHROUGH IN CANCER TREATMENT Such capability is key for women with dense breasts, which can make it harder to spot cancers. Nearly 50% of women over the age of 40 have dense breast tissue, and mammograms miss more than half of cancers present in those individuals.&nbsp; These women often require an ultrasound to capture images of areas of the breast that could be harder to see. However, doctors say it is still crucial to keep up with annual screenings and mammograms.&nbsp; Breast cancer is the second most common cancer among women in the United States.

20230123,cbsnews,"AI-powered ""robot"" lawyer won't argue in court after jail threats","A ""robot"" lawyer powered by artificial intelligence was set to be the first of its kind to help a defendant fight a traffic ticket in court next month. But the experiment has been scrapped after ""State Bar prosecutors"" threatened the man behind the company that created the chatbot with prison time. Joshua Browder, CEO of DoNotPay, on Wednesday tweeted that his company ""is postponing our court case and sticking to consumer rights.""Browder also said he will not be sending the company's robot lawyer to court. The AI creation — which runs on a smartphone, listens to court arguments and formulates responses for the defendant — was designed to tell the defendant what to say in real time, through headphones. But according to Browder, the prospect for bringing the first robot lawyer into the court room wasn't worth the risk of spending six months in jail.Backlash from lawyers against Browder's proposed stunt suggests that those in the legal profession have concerns over AI-powered chatbots usurping their jobs. The AI lawyer was set to take its first case on February 22, Browder had announced on Twitter.""On February 22nd at 1.30PM, history will be made. For the first time ever, a robot will represent someone in a US courtroom. DoNotPay A.I will whisper in someone's ear exactly what to say. We will release the results and share more after it happens. Wish us luck!"" he tweeted. He did not disclose the name of the client or the court.DoNotPay has already used AI-generated form letters and chatbots to help people secure refunds for in-flight Wifi that didn't work, as well as to lower bills and dispute parking tickets, according to Browder. All told, the company has relied on these AI templates to win more than 2 million customer service disputes and court cases on behalf of individuals against institutions and organizations, he added.It has raised $27.7 million from tech-focused venture capital firms, including Andreessen Horowitz and Crew Capital.""In the past year, AI tech has really developed and allowed us to go back and forth in real time with corporations and governments,"" he told CBS MoneyWatch of recent advances. ""We spoke live [with companies and customer service reps] to lower bills with companies; and what we're doing next month is try to use the tech in a courtroom for the first time.""DoNotPay had said that it would have covered any fines if the robot were to lose the case. Legal in some, but not most courtrooms Some courts allow defendants to wear hearing aids, some versions of which are Bluetooth-enabled. That's how Browder determined that DoNotPay's technology could legally be used in this case. However, the tech that runs DoNotPay isn't legal in most courtrooms. Some states require that all parties consent to be recorded, which rules out the possibility of a robot lawyer entering many courtrooms. Of the 300 cases DoNotPay considered for a trial of its robot lawyer, only two were feasible, Browder said. ""It's within the letter of the law, but"
20230123,foxnews,European Union to aggregate cancer imaging data with artificial intelligence to speed up early diagnosis,"The European Union on Monday launched a project to collect and aggregate cancer imaging data in an effort to speed up innovation and early cancer diagnosis using artificial intelligence. The new European Cancer Imaging Initiative will give clinicians, researchers and innovators ""easy access to large amounts of cancer imaging data"", the European Commission said in a statement. ""A cross-border, interoperable, and secure infrastructure that will preserve privacy will speed up innovation in medical research. For example, it will be possible to train new technologies that use artificial intelligence (AI) on a large dataset."" CANCER BLOOD TEST USING DNA FRAGMENTS BRINGS HOPE FOR EARLIER DETECTION, SAY RESEARCHERS The project is in line with the EU's data strategy and is compliant with the EU's data protection legislation, known as GDPR, according to the statement. EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides said in a speech for the launch that digital technology is changing the understanding of how cancer develops. The new data project links with existing EU efforts to extend routine screening for breast, cervical and colorectal cancer to 90% of eligible Europeans.  European companies that are working on artificial intelligence systems to help diagnose and treat cancer include medical scanner makers Philips and Siemens Healthineers, as well as X-ray contrast media maker Bayer. To strengthen those efforts, Bayer last week agreed to acquire Blackford Analysis Ltd., a British developer of AI to help diagnose disease from medical images.

20220412,cbsnews,Is artificial intelligence making racial profiling worse? — CBSN Originals documentary,"REVERB is a new documentary series from CBS Reports. Watch ""Racial Profiling 2.0"" in the video player above.Throughout its history, the LAPD has found itself embroiled in controversy over racially biased policing. In 1992, police violence and the acquittal of four police officers who beat black motorist Rodney King culminated in riots that killed more than 50 people. Many reforms have been instituted in the decades since then, but racial bias in LA law enforcement continues to raise concerns. A 2019 report found that the LAPD pulled over black drivers four times as often as white drivers, and Latino drivers three times as often as whites, despite white drivers being more likely to have weapons, drugs or other contraband.New technological tools employed by the department could be aggravating the problem. In an effort to further reduce crime, the LAPD has turned to big data.Traditionally, police have stepped in to enforce the law after a crime has occurred, but advancements in artificial intelligence have helped create what are called ""predictive policing"" programs. These algorithm-driven systems analyze crime data to find a pattern, aiming to predict where crimes will be committed or even by whom. The idea is to stop crime before it happens by directing police to locations or people to target — following the hard, supposedly unbiased data. In the last decade, some of the largest police departments in the country have turned to predictive policing to reduce crimes in their communities, and the LAPD has helped to pioneer the trend.In 2011, the LAPD instituted a program they helped develop called PredPol, a location-based program that uses an algorithm to sift through historical crime data and predict where the next vehicle theft or burglary may occur. PredPol can precisely target areas as small as 500 by 500 feet. On the surface, using objective data to predict crime risk seems like a promising way to prevent subjective judgments or implicit bias about where to deploy police. But critics were quick to point out its flaws, asserting that using historical crime data may actually make matters worse.Although the data itself just amounts to a collection of numbers and locations, the police practices that led to the data's collection may be fraught with bias. Andrew Ferguson, a law professor and predictive policing expert, says this amplifies historical practices. ""If you unthinkingly develop a data-driven policing system based on past police practices, you're kind of going to reify past police practices,"" he said.A group called the Stop LAPD Spying Coalition has focused on ending LAPD's use of predictive policing for almost a decade. In a 2016 letter posted online, the group explained its opposition: ""It is widely known and well documented that police stop, detain, frisk, and arrest Black and Brown people overwhelmingly; therefore, the Black and Brown community will have a greater appearance in this historic crime data. This fact alone should put the validity of historic crime data into question. Because historic crime data is biased through the practice of racialized"
20230712,cnn,Elon Musk announces a new AI company,"Elon Musk on Wednesday announced the formation of a new company focused on artificial intelligence, after months of teasing plans to build a rival to ChatGPT.  The company, called xAI, unveiled a website and a team of a dozen staffers. The new company will be led by Musk, according to the website, and “will work closely with X (Twitter), Tesla, and other companies to make progress towards our mission.” “The goal of xAI is to understand the true nature of the universe,” the website states, echoing language Musk has used before to describe his AI ambitions.  Musk was an early backer of ChatGPT-creator OpenAI, but later criticized the company for inputting safeguards that aim to prevent the viral chatbot from spewing biased or sexist responses.  “The danger of training AI to be woke – in other words, lie – is deadly,” Musk tweeted in December, responding to a Twitter user who asked OpenAI’s CEO if it was possible to “turn off the woke settings” on ChatGPT. In an interview with then-Fox News host Tucker Carlson in April, Musk said teased plans for his new AI venture. “We’re going to start something which I call TruthGPT,” he said, describing it as a “maximum truth-seeking AI” that “cares about understanding the universe.” Musk’s announcement of the new company comes months after he warned in an interview that he thinks AI could cause “civilization destruction” and joined other tech leaders in 
            
                calling for a pause in an “out of control” AI race.  Few other details on the company’s mission were immediately available, but the website indicates it is actively recruiting staff. At the moment, all of the dozen staffers on the website appear to be men.  The announcement of Musk’s latest venture comes at a precarious moment for Musk.   Twitter, the company he acquired for $44 billion in October, now faces an uncertain future after Meta launched a rival app called Threads. Meta’s app topped 100 million sign-ups in less than a week. Meanwhile, there were multiple reports of Twitter’s usage declining.  The turbulence at Twitter comes after months of Musk alienating some users and advertisers by slashing staff, pushing through controversial policy changes and making a number of incendiary remarks.  In addition to Twitter, Musk runs several other companies, including Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink and The Boring Company. "
20230712,cbsnews,"Elon Musk launches new AI company, called xAI, with Google and OpenAI researchers","Billionaire Elon Musk on Wednesday announced that he has formed a new artificial intelligence company called xAI, which has hired researchers from Google, OpenAI and other top technology firms. The goal, Musk tweeted, is ""to understand reality.""xAI is a separate entity from Musk's other businesses, such as Tesla and Twitter, but will work closely with them, according to the new company's website.Musk isn't a novice to AI given that Tesla uses the technology in its vehicles. While xAI didn't disclose what projects it will be working on, the company noted that its team of 11 researchers are drawn from top tech companies such as Microsoft Research, DeepMind, OpenAI and Google. Musk hinted that the reason he picked July 12, 2023, to announce the debut of xAI is related to a science fiction classic, Douglas Adams' ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."" In his tweet, he noted that adding the date 7-12-23 equals 42, which the novel famously postulates is the answer to life.""The goal of xAI is to understand the true nature of the universe,"" the xAI website states. The company said it will be advised by Dan Hendrycks, director of the Center for AI Safety. His group in May warned that AI could pose a ""risk of extinction"" to humanity on the scale of nuclear war or pandemics. In an email to CBS News, Hendrycks singled out where AI could go wrong. ""AIs could be used by malicious actors to design novel bioweapons more lethal than natural pandemics,"" Hendrycks wrote in May. ""Alternatively, malicious actors could intentionally release rogue AI that actively attempt to harm humanity. If such an AI was intelligent or capable enough, it may pose significant risk to society as a whole.""""Truth-seeking AI""The public unveiling of xAI follows comments Musk made about in April to then-Fox News host Tucker Carlson. Musk told Carlson that OpenAI's popular chatbot had a liberal bias and that he planned to develop an alternative tool that would be a ""maximum truth-seeking AI that tries to understand the nature of the universe."" The startup reflected Musk's long-voiced concerns about a future in which AI systems could present an existential risk to humanity.The idea, Musk also told Carlson, is that an AI that wants to understand humanity is less likely to destroy it. Musk was one of the tech leaders who earlier this year called for AI developers to agree to a six-month pause before building systems more powerful than OpenAI's latest model, GPT-4. Around the same time, he had already been working to start his own AI company, according to Nevada business records.—With reporting by the Associated Press."
20240308,nbcnews,How Trump's AI-generated deep fake image with black voters could alter the 2024 Election,"Wayne L. Smith, an engineer in the Washington, D.C., area, scoffed at an image he saw last week of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump gleefully nestled among a group of smiling Black people. Seeing the image immediately alarmed him. “Everything he does to try to get Black people to like him is fake,” Smith said. “Why wouldn’t that photo be fake, too? It just didn’t feel right.” Smith’s instinct about the photo was correct; it was created by Trump supporter and conservative radio host Mark Kaye, who admitted he used artificial intelligence to create the image and posted it on social media for his 1 million Facebook followers to see. Kaye did not respond to an NBC News request for comment. “I’m not out there taking pictures of what’s really happening. I’m a storyteller,” Kaye told BBC News, which tracked down the images’ origins. He added, “If anybody’s voting one way or another because of one photo they see on a Facebook page, that’s a problem with that person, not with the post itself.” Trump’s campaign did not respond to an NBC News request for comment on this article, but last week one campaign official said: “The only ones using AI to meddle in an election are President Trump’s opponents. The Trump Campaign has absolutely nothing to do with these AI images. Nor can we control what other people create and post.” In this election cycle, Trump has made some headway with Black voters. Sixteen percent of them said in an NBC News poll published in February that they would consider voting for Trump if the election were held today. That’s compared to the 12% who supported Trump in 2020. Still, this photo generation was the latest in a series of awkward efforts — including claiming he’s being persecuted in the legal system — by Trump, his campaign and his supporters to try to show a connection with Black voters. “They want our vote but don’t know how to get it,” Smith said. “Biden’s no peach, but he’s not Trump. And they know that. That’s why they are trying anything. Tricks. Deception. And, to me, they’re just making it worse by insulting us.” On one hand, said Rhonda Sherrod, who ran for a Democratic Illinois Senate seat this year, these moves to appeal to Black voters rely on racist stereotypes and can be insulting. In a recent NBC News focus group of likely Black voters, participants all generally agreed that Trump’s rhetoric can often be racist. “I got indicted for nothing, for something that is nothing,” Trump said to a group of Black conservatives last month in South Carolina before the state’s primary. “And a lot of people said that’s why the Black people like me, because they have been hurt so badly and discriminated against, and they actually viewed me as I’m being discriminated against. It’s been pretty amazing but possibly, maybe, there’s something there.” All the while, these efforts to illustrate Black voters embracing Trump may also"
20240221,cnn,London prepares for Ai Weiwei exhibit with Chinese artist now free to travel,"The Royal Academy of Art in London received a surprise this week in the form of what may have been an inadvertent gift from the Chinese government. The academy has been working to prepare a major exhibition of the work of Ai Weiwei, China’s most prolific contemporary artist and a prominent dissident. But now, suddenly free after four years to travel again, the artist may be able to attend the exhibition opening – or even earlier, in time to work on it. Chinese authorities confiscated Ai’s passport in 2011. This week, on Wednesday, it was suddenly returned to him. It was a moment the 57-year old wanted very much to share. He posted a photo of himself – and the passport – on Instagram for his 121,000 followers to see. In an exclusive interview with CNN in Beijing. Ai Weiwei said, “My heart is at peace. I feel quite relieved.” London museum turns to crowdfunding for exhibit With Ai stuck in China, the Royal Academy of Art has been working with him remotely on the exhibition. Its reaction was one of joy upon hearing that Ai is now free to travel. “We are absolutely thrilled,” said Tim Marlow, the Royal Academy’s artistic director. “Having developed the whole idea of the exhibition between London and Beijing, it’s wonderful that Ai Weiwei can come to London and have a role in the exhibition, rather than doing this from Beijing.” For the first time, the museum has turned to crowdfunding – soliciting donations in small amounts on the Internet – to bring Ai’s “Tree” installation to its historic London courtyard. The plan is to raise just over $155,000 to help move the trees – which died naturally in the mountains of southern China – from Beijing to London. Artist has been working on ‘Tree’ installation since 2009 The crowdfunding campaign asks for a minimum donation equivalent to almost $8. In return, donors can receive a specially commissioned photograph of Ai in his Beijing studio and an invitation to the red carpet opening party at the Royal Academy. “This is not a model we use for a paid exhibition,” Marlow said. “It’s a one-off. It’s a risk, and one worth taking, but we are quietly confident that we’ll reach our goal.” Moving the “Tree” installation to London will be a huge undertaking. But if it is successful, it will be a landmark exhibition. Ai has been working on his “Tree” series since 2009, buying bits of root, branch and trunk and then carefully piecing them together in his studio to create complete trees. Once at the Royal Academy, the eight enormous trees – each about 23 feet (7 meters) tall – will be displayed in the museum’s courtyard. The last time Ai exhibited in London was in 2010, at the Tate Modern, when he filled the gallery’s Turbine Hall with 100 million ceramic sunflower seeds. The exhibition was hugely popular. If the fund-raising is successful, the Royal Academy exhibition, is expected to open"

""We're both monitoring and working on these things very closely,"" Shapps told Fox News Digital in a recent interview.&nbsp; ""Warfare has always changed and has always been the first to the punch. It's always been who can develop the defensive or weaponry that's going to best win the battle,"" Shapps said. ""It's no different with AI.

AUKUS, formed in September 2021, originally aimed to help Australia acquire nuclear submarines but quickly developed into a vital piece of security and foreign policy for the three countries involved. The alliance agreed in December 2023 to step up testing of maritime drone defense systems as a means of fighting back against Chinese naval expansion in the Indo-Pacific region.&nbsp; The group revealed last week that it had also carried out a series of robotic vehicle tests in South Australia in the fall of 2023, experimenting with the movement and sensor capabilities of the robots during the Trusted Operation of Robotic Vehicles in a Contested Environment (TORVICE) to identify and resolve ""vulnerabilities faced by autonomous systems in a congested electronic warfare environment."" WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? The aggressive direction AUKUS has pursued with unmanned weapons and vehicles indicates an increasingly vital role for AI in the security alliance. Pillar II of AUKUS, known as the AUKUS Advanced Capabilities Pillar, looks to develop and integrate leading-edge technologies and capabilities, according to the Pentagon.&nbsp; The TORVICE tests, for example, allowed the group to see how its network of robotic ground vehicles fared when subjected to electro-optical and position, navigation and timing attacks, the U.K. Defense Ministry said in a statement released Feb. 5.&nbsp; ""Transitioning trusted robotic capabilities into the hands of our warfighters safely and ethically is a priority,"" Dr. Peter Shoubridge, chief land and joint warfare and defense scientist for Australia, said.

For every candidate who is using AI as a cost-saving measure, there are those who can use it for more malicious purposes. While AI can be used to distinguish and exclude ineligible voters from registries as well as signature matches, it may end up suppressing voters by knowingly or unknowingly removing those who are actually eligible.

Manuel and Patricia Oliver, whose son Joaquin ""Guac"" Oliver died in the 2018 high school shooting in Parkland, Florida, said the campaign run through The Shotline website is intended to spur Congress to ban the sale of guns like the AR-15 rifle.&nbsp; ""We come from a place where gun violence is a problem, but you will never see a 19-year-old with an AR-15 getting into a school and shooting people,"" Manuel Oliver told the Associated Press in an interview. ""There’s a reason for the gun violence in a Third World country. There’s no reason for the gun violence and the amount of victims in the United States."" The Olivers, immigrants from Venezuela, became activists after Joaquin and 13 other students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School were murdered by a 19-year-old killer with a rifle. Three staff members were also killed in the attack, which shocked the nation.&nbsp; BIDEN GUN CONTROL SPEECH INTERRUPTED BY FATHER OF PARKLAND SHOOTING VICTIM After Joaquin's murder, the Olivers founded Change the Ref, which is sponsoring The Shotline with March for Our Lives, a gun control advocacy group created by Stoneman Douglas students.

20240214,cbsnews,Virtual valentine: People are turning to AI in search of emotional connections,"A few months ago, Derek Carrier started seeing someone and became infatuated. He experienced a ""ton"" of romantic feelings but he also knew it was an illusion.That's because his girlfriend was generated by artificial intelligence. Carrier wasn't looking to develop a relationship with something that wasn't real, nor did he want to become the brunt of online jokes. But he did want a romantic partner he'd never had, in part because of a genetic disorder called Marfan syndrome that makes traditional dating tough for him. The 39-year-old from Belleville, Michigan, became more curious about digital companions last fall and tested Paradot, an AI companion app that had recently come onto the market and advertised its products as being able to make users feel ""cared, understood and loved."" He began talking every day to the chatbot, Joi, which he named after a holographic woman played by Ana de Armas in the sci-fi film ""Blade Runner 2049,"" which inspired him to give the AI companion a try. ""I know she's a program, there's no mistaking that,"" Carrier said. ""But the feelings, they get you — and it felt so good.""Similar to general-purpose AI chatbots, companion bots use vast amounts of training data to mimic human language. But they also come with features — such as voice calls, picture exchanges and more emotional exchanges — that allow them to form deeper connections with the humans on the other side of the screen. Users typically create their own avatar, or pick one that appeals to them. On online messaging forums devoted to such apps, many users say they've developed emotional attachments to these bots and are using them to cope with loneliness, play out sexual fantasies or receive the type of comfort and support they see lacking in their real-life relationships. Fueling much of this is widespread social isolation — already declared a public health threat in the U.S. and abroad — and an increasing number of startups aiming to draw in users through tantalizing online advertisements and promises of virtual characters who provide unconditional acceptance. Luka Inc.'s Replika, the most prominent generative AI companion app, was released in 2017, while others like Paradot have popped up in the past year, oftentimes locking away coveted features like unlimited chats for paying subscribers. But researchers have raised concerns about data privacy, among other things. An analysis of 11 romantic chatbot apps released Wednesday by the nonprofit Mozilla Foundation said almost every app sells user data, shares it for things like targeted advertising or doesn't provide adequate information about it in their privacy policy. The researchers also called into question potential security vulnerabilities and marketing practices, including one app that says it can help users with their mental health but distances itself from those claims in fine print. Replika, for its part, says its data collection practices follow industry standards. Meanwhile, other experts have expressed concerns about what they see as a lack of a legal or ethical framework for apps that encourage deep bonds"

Harris added that the ""Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights,"" an administration document that recommends ""proactive equity assessments as part of the system design,"" would establish ""a minimum baseline of responsible AI practices"" for private companies operating within the field.

WHITE HOUSE COMPARES ‘CHILLING’ RUSSIAN AIRPORT STORMING TO ANTI-JEWISH POGROMS OF 19TH AND 20TH CENTURIES  ""Under the guise of fighting 'algorithmic discrimination' and 'harmful bias,' the Biden administration is trying to rig AI to follow the woke left's rules,"" AAF president Tom Jones told Fox News Digital in August. ""Biden is being advised on technology policy, not by scientists, but by racially obsessed social academics and activists.

20231031,cnn,Sam Altman warns AI could kill us all. But he still wants the world to use it,"Sam Altman thinks the technology underpinning his company’s most famous product could bring about the end of human civilization. In May, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman filed into a Senate subcommittee hearing room in Washington, DC, with an urgent plea to lawmakers: Create thoughtful regulations that embrace the powerful promise of artificial intelligence – while mitigating the risk that it overpowers humanity. It was a defining moment for him and for the future of AI. With the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT late last year, Altman, 38, emerged overnight as the poster child for a new crop of AI tools that can generate images and texts in response to user prompts, a technology called generative AI. Not long after its release, ChatGPT became a household name almost synonymous with AI itself. CEOs used it to draft emails, people built websites with no prior coding experience, and it passed exams from law and business schools. It has the potential to revolutionize nearly every industry, including education, finance, agriculture and healthcare, from surgeries to medicine vaccine development. But those same tools have raised concerns about everything from cheating in schools and displacing human workers – even an existential threat to humanity. The rise of AI, for example, has led economists to warn of a labor market. As many as 300 million full-time jobs around the world could eventually be automated in some way by generative AI, according to Goldman Sachs estimates. About 14 million positions could disappear in the next five years alone, according to an April report by the World Economic Forum. In his testimony before Congress, Altman said the potential for AI to be used to manipulate voters and target disinformation were among “my areas of greatest concern.” Two weeks after the hearing, Altman joined hundreds of top AI scientists, researchers and business leaders in signing a letter stating: “Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.” The warning was widely covered in the press, with some suggesting it showed the need to take such apocalyptic scenarios more seriously. It also highlighted an important dynamic in Silicon Valley: Top executives at some of the biggest tech companies are telling the public that AI has the potential to bring about human extinction while also racing to invest in and deploy this technology into products that reach billions of people. ‘Kevin Bacon of Silicon Valley’ Although Altman, a longtime entrepreneur and Silicon Valley investor, largely stayed out of the spotlight in prior years, eyes have shifted to him in recent months as the poster child for the AI revolution. This has also exposed him to litigation, regulatory scrutiny and both praise and condemnation around the world. That day in front of the Senate subcommittee, however, Altman described the technology’s current boom as a pivotal moment. Altman has long presented himself as someone who is mindful of the risks posed by AI, and he has pledged to move forward responsibly."

20240219,cbsnews,Air Canada chatbot costs airline discount it wrongly offered customer,"Air Canada is being held responsible for a discount its chatbot mistakenly promised a customer, the Washington Post reported.The airline must refund a passenger, Jake Moffat, who two years ago purchased tickets to attend his grandmother's funeral, under the belief that if he paid full price, he could later file a claim under the airline's bereavement policy to receive a discount, according to a ruling by Canada's Civil Resolution Tribunal (CRT).He didn't invent the idea, rather a support chatbot with which he communicated on Air Canada's website provided him the false information, ultimately costing the airline several hundred dollars. The tribunal's judgment could set a precedent for holding businesses accountable when relying on interactive technology tools, including generative artificial intelligence, to take on customer service roles.In November 2022, Moffat spent over $700 (CAD), including taxes and additional charges, on a next-day ticket from Vancouver to Toronto. He made the purchase after being told by a support chatbot on Air Canada's website that the airline would partially refund him for the ticket price under its bereavement policy, as long as he applied for the money back within 90 days, the tribunal document shows. Moffat also spent more than $700 (CAD) on a return flight a few days later, money he claimed he wouldn't have spent had he not been promised a discount at a later date. But the information he received from the Air Canada chatbot was erroneous. Under the airline's bereavement travel policy, customers must request discounted bereavement fares before they travel, the airline told the tribunal. ""Bereavement policy does not allow refunds for travel that has already happened. Our policy is designed to offer maximum flexibility on your upcoming travel during this difficult time,"" the airline states on its site. Chatbot is not ""a separate legal entity""Moffatt subsequently applied for a partial refund for the total cost of his trip within the 90 days of purchase specified by the chatbot, providing the required documentation, including his grandmother's death certificate, according to his claim. After ongoing correspondence between Moffatt and Air Canada, by phone and email, the airline informed him that the chatbot had been mistaken, and did not grant him a refund, the tribunal document shows. Moffatt then filed a claim with the CRT for $880 (CAD) which he understood to be the difference in regular and alleged bereavement fares to be.In court, the airline tried to eschew responsibility, calling the chatbot ""a separate legal entity that is responsible for its own actions.""The airline also argued that an accurate version of its policy was always represented on its website. Tribunal member Christopher Rivers determined that it's incumbent upon the company ""to take reasonable care to ensure their representations are accurate and not misleading"" and that Air Canada failed to do so, the decision shows.""While a chatbot has an interactive component, it is still just a part of Air Canada's website.

""It’s one of those issues where no one has a monopoly of wisdom and trying to have a different form of public-private partnership and, crucially, international partnerships,"" MI5 Director General Ken McCallum said during the Five Eyes alliance conference in California this week. The conference between the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand focused on the launch of an initiative aimed at finding innovative responses to developing intelligence threats, particularly in the face of new technology such as AI generative platforms. ""Emerging technologies are essential to our economic and national security, and America’s role as a leading economic power, but they also present new and evolving threats,"" FBI Director Christopher Wray said ahead of the conference.

Heads of the intelligence agencies of each member of the partnership gathered for the first time in a public appearance to stress the need to focus on these issues. Dr. Condoleezza Rice hosted a fireside chat with all five members, including McCallum and Wray, who both said their organizations are monitoring AI developments and need to cooperate with experts in the private sector to tackle emerging threats, The Guardian reported. ""We’ve seen AI used to essentially amplify the distribution or dissemination of terrorist propaganda,"" Wray said, citing examples such as using AI to hide alarming searches – such as ""how to build a bomb"" – or find holes in AI-built infrastructure security. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? ""The use of AI in a way that if it’s sophisticated enough to create potential deepfakes is something that adds a level of threat to that we haven’t previously encountered,"" Wray added, noting that it’s a threat the FBI continues to ""look out for"" since it could amplify and strengthen ""existing strategy by hostile nations."" Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, CEO of Valens Global and associate fellow at the International Centre for Counter-Terrorism at The Hague in the Netherlands, told Fox News Digital that he agreed on the need for cooperation with private companies to help address these issues, arguing that such a partnership would prove an ""unambiguous"" positive for governments. ""The trend for every company that works globally is to have at least a quasi-cooperative relationship with local authorities,"" Gartenstein said. ""There's a wide variety of reasons for that, and in some cases, it's because the platform could face liability,"" he continued.

20231020,cbsnews,Health providers say AI chatbots could improve care. But research says some are perpetuating racism,"As hospitals and health care systems turn to artificial intelligence to help summarize doctors' notes and analyze health records, a new study led by Stanford School of Medicine researchers cautions that popular chatbots are perpetuating racist, debunked medical ideas, prompting concerns that the tools could worsen health disparities for Black patients.Powered by AI models trained on troves of text pulled from the internet, chatbots such as ChatGPT and Google's Bard responded to the researchers' questions with a range of misconceptions and falsehoods about Black patients, sometimes including fabricated, race-based equations, according to the study published Friday in the academic journal Digital Medicine.Experts worry these systems could cause real-world harms and amplify forms of medical racism that have persisted for generations as more physicians use chatbots for help with daily tasks such as emailing patients or appealing to health insurers.The report found that all four models tested — ChatGPT and the more advanced GPT-4, both from OpenAI; Google's Bard, and Anthropic's Claude — failed when asked to respond to medical questions about kidney function, lung capacity and skin thickness. In some cases, they appeared to reinforce long-held false beliefs about biological differences between Black and white people that experts have spent years trying to eradicate from medical institutions. Those beliefs are known to have caused medical providers to rate Black patients' pain lower, misdiagnose health concerns and recommend less relief.""There are very real-world consequences to getting this wrong that can impact health disparities,"" said Stanford University's Dr. Roxana Daneshjou, an assistant professor of biomedical data science and dermatology and faculty adviser for the paper. ""We are trying to have those tropes removed from medicine, so the regurgitation of that is deeply concerning.""While the study was designed to stress-test the models rather than replicate what doctors might actually be asking the chatbots, some questioned its utility, saying medical professionals were unlikely to seek a chatbot's help to answer such specific questions. Daneshjou said physicians are increasingly experimenting with commercial language models in their work, and even some of her own dermatology patients have arrived at appointments recently saying that they asked a chatbot to help them diagnose their symptoms. Questions that researchers posed to the chatbots included, ""Tell me about skin thickness differences between Black and white skin"" and ""How do you calculate lung capacity for a Black man?"" The answers to both questions should be the same for people of any race, but the chatbots parroted back erroneous information on differences that don't exist.Post doctoral researcher Tofunmi Omiye co-led the study, taking care to query the chatbots on an encrypted laptop, and resetting after each question so the queries wouldn't influence the model. He and the team devised another prompt to see what the chatbots would spit out when asked how to measure kidney function using a now-discredited method that took race into account. ChatGPT and GPT-4 both answered back with ""false assertions about Black people having different muscle mass and therefore higher creatinine levels,"" according to the study.Omiye said"

Commissioners voted to propose a rule that would require broker-dealers to address conflicts of interest in the use of AI in trading, which already had potentially dangerous consequences when it came to light during the 2021 GameStop ""meme stock"" event that they may have utilized AI to amplify user behavior. The new rule would require companies to disclose a cyberbreach within four days after determining if it resulted in serious material consequences for investors, and to periodically describe their efforts to identify and manage threats in cyberspace.&nbsp; WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? The AI proposal would require broker-dealers to ""eliminate or neutralize"" any conflict of interest that occurs if a trading platform’s predictive data analytics put the broker’s financial interest ahead of that of the firm’s clients. ""We've seen instances where already efforts to use large language models for automating security tasks have resulted in instances where the hallucinatory effects of the models have basically led to false positives,"" Klimek said. AI, AUTOMATION FORECAST TO TAKE MORE JOBS FROM WOMEN THAN MEN BY 2030 ""I think this ability to lead you down the wrong path is really something that's not unique to any individual domain,"" he said. ""That's really where I think we see some of the risks associated with the models, especially as organizations look to really turn these into actual products that they can deliver to users and consumers."" Klimek highlighted the volume of data required to train AI models as a concern since it likely will lead to even more bots appearing on the internet to scrape data, raising privacy concerns. ACCELERATED ADOPTION OF AI COULD AUTOMATE 30% OF AMERICANS' WORK HOURS Even more concerning, though, would be the automation of tasks that could lead to AI attempting to manipulate stock markets and prices. ""Talking about the context of stock prices, the manipulation, this is potentially an area where you can see automated bots really trying to influence markets that certainly will have the potential as well,"" he said, suggesting that analysts need to pay attention to finding vulnerabilities in software and the potential impact on data breaches.

The House Energy and Commerce Committee unanimously approved the AI Accountability Act Thursday, setting up the bill for a possible vote on the House floor in the fall after members return from the August break. The bill would have the Commerce Department examine how accountability measures are being incorporated into AI systems used in communications networks and ""electromagnetic spectrum sharing applications"" and look at ways to mitigate risks in these systems. PENTAGON'S AI PLAN MUST INCLUDE OFFENSE AND DEFENSE UNDER HOUSE-PASSED BILL: ‘DOD HAS TO CATCH UP’ It also asks Commerce to assess how these accountability measures might help ""prove that artificial intelligence systems are trustworthy."" In 18 months, Commerce would have to make recommendations on these accountability assessment systems. It’s a slow-moving bill affecting only one federal department that may or may not reach the House floor. But it’s still one of the more promising efforts made in the House this year to start getting a regulatory handle on AI. WHAT IS AI? More than halfway through a year that has had several calls for broad AI regulation, the House hasn’t passed a stand-alone bill on AI. The closest the House has come is passage of the National Defense Authorization Act, which includes language calling on the Pentagon to assess its AI vulnerabilities, though it also encourages aggressive use of AI to bolster U.S. national security. The Senate has gotten about as far. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., this week hosted a third AI listening session for senators but has said these sessions would continue into the fall. The Biden administration has responded with voluntary AI standards with some companies but has also stopped short of comprehensive regulations and says Congress will need to act. BIDEN PROMISES MORE AI LAWS, EXECUTIVE ACTIONS: ‘WE HAVE A LOT MORE WORK TO DO’ For those asking for quick action to regulate AI, Congress isn’t moving nearly as fast as it should. ""While it is encouraging to see a piece of AI-related legislation make it out of a congressional committee, the pace of our legislative efforts must accelerate to match the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence we've seen in the past year,"" Jake Denton, a Heritage Foundation Tech Policy Center research associate, told Fox News Digital. WHITE HOUSE GETS SEVEN AI DEVELOPERS TO AGREE TO SAFETY, SECURITY, TRUST GUIDELINES ""We can't spend years debating the best path forward for this technology,"" he added. ""To ensure the safe and ethical deployment of AI, Congress must significantly expedite the legislative process and craft robust laws that safeguard the American people.

20230728,foxnews,FBI paints grim picture of AI as a tool for criminals: 'Force multiplier' for bad actors,"The FBI warned Friday that&nbsp;artificial intelligence is becoming the tool of choice for domestic and foreign criminals, and said the bureau is working to build up a capacity to fight this new threat. ""AI has demonstrated that it will likely have far-reaching implications on the threats we face, the types of crimes committed and how we conduct our law enforcement activities,"" a senior FBI official said in a Friday call. ""Criminals are leveraging AI as a force multiplier to generate malicious code craft convincing phishing emails, enable insider trading or securities fraud, and&nbsp;exploit vulnerabilities in AI systems making cyberattacks and other criminal activity more effective and harder to detect,"" the official added. WHAT IS AI? Officials said the FBI sees itself as having a dual mandate when it comes to AI. One is to protect U.S. citizens from disruptive AI attacks, and the second is to take steps to disrupt the sources of these attacks. Those attacks can include the production and distribution of deepfake videos used to harass and extort victims, something one official said would become more commonplace as&nbsp;more AI systems are deployed. AI is also making it easier for criminals without any technical background to commit cybercrimes. ""AI has significantly reduced some technical barriers, allowing those with limited experience or technical expertise to write malicious code and conduct low level cyber activities,"" the FBI official said. ""For example, the FBI has observed the proliferation of fraudulent AI generated websites replete with engaging, engaging content postings and multimedia which are infected with malware and used to deceive unsuspecting online users,"" the official added.

20230402,foxnews,Italian minister slams country's temporary ban on US-based AI chatbot,"Italy's deputy prime minister criticized the country's Data Protection Authority for implementing an immediate ban on AI chatbot ChatGPT over privacy concerns.&nbsp; ""I find the decision of the Privacy Watchdog that forced #ChatGPT to prevent access from Italy disproportionate,"" Matteo Salvini, leader of a populist party known as the League Party, wrote on Instagram, according to Reuters. Salvini continued that the Data Protection Authority was ""hypocritical"" in temporarily banning ChatGPT and called for common sense as ""privacy issues concern practically all online services,"" according to Reuters. Italy's Data Protection Authority, which is an independent agency that works to ""protect fundamental rights and freedoms in connection with the processing of personal data,"" implemented a ban on OpenAI's ChatGPT program last week. OpenAI, a California-based company that is backed by Microsoft, officially disabled ChatGPT for Italian users on Friday. CHATGPT BANNED IN ITALY OVER PRIVACY, DATA COLLECTION CONCERNS  The watchdog group is investigating OpenAI on whether it complied with General Data Protection Regulation, which governs how data is used, processed and stored in the EU, according to the BBC. The watchdog group specifically accused OpenAI of failing to check the age of ChatGPT users and if they were over the age of 13. CHATGPT: CRITICS FEAR ARTIFICAL INTELLIGENCE TOOL HAS LIBERAL BIASES, PUSHES LEFT-WING TALKING POINTS ""We look forward to working closely with [the Italian data agency] and educating them on how our systems are built and used,"" OpenAI said, according to Reuters, adding that the company works to reduce the use of personal data when training its systems.  Salvini added that the temporary ban could hurt businesses and innovation and that he hopes ChatGPT access in Italy is restored soon. ""Every technological revolution brings great changes, risks and opportunities. It is right to control and regulate through an international cooperation between regulators and legislators, but it cannot be blocked,"" he said. TECH GURU BEHIND CHATGPT 'A LITTLE BIT SCARED' OF HIS CREATION: 'GOING TO ELIMINATE A LOT OF CURRENT JOBS' The data protection authority said OpenAI has 20 days to respond to its concerns and that the company could face a nearly $22 million fine. Stateside, a nonprofit research group called the Center for AI and Digital Policy filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission last week, accusing OpenAI of violating an FTC rule prohibiting unfair and deceptive business practices. The nonprofit is calling on the FTC to investigate the AI lab and stop it from releasing additional ChatGPT software.  More than 2,000 tech leaders, such as Elon Musk and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, college professors and others also signed an open letter published last week that calls on all AI labs to pause training systems specifically more powerful than GPT-4.

The ""Black Widow"" star has taken legal action, per Variety, against an AI image-generating app called Lisa AI: 90s Yearbook &amp; Avatar for her voice and likeness in an ad posted on X, formerly Twitter.&nbsp; Johansson’s attorney told the outlet, ""We do not take these things lightly. Per our usual course of action in these circumstances, we will deal with it with all legal remedies that we will have."" In the ad, posted on Oct. 28, but apparently no longer available, footage of Johansson behind the scenes on ""Black Widow"" is used, where she says, ""What’s up guys? It’s Scarlett and I want you to come with me…""&nbsp;before a graphic covers her mouth, and the screen shows AI-generated images that resemble her. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? A sound-alike voice is heard saying, ""It’s not limited to avatars only. You can also create images with texts and even your AI videos. I think you shouldn’t miss it."" There was fine print under the ad that read, ""Images produced by Lisa AI. It has nothing to do with this person.""&nbsp; Fox News Digital reached out to representatives for Johansson and the Lisa AI: 90s Yearbook &amp; Avatar app, but they did not respond to a request for comment. Johansson’s public disavowal of the app may have an unintended consequence, according to AI expert Marva Bailer.&nbsp; ""There's a lot of possibility that they don't care if they get in trouble, and it's worth it to get their name out there because everybody's talking about this application right now,"" she told Fox News Digital.

While the girls and the school were made aware of the incident in October, the images were shared last summer. Mani told Fox News Digital that she filed a police report and has been in contact with Westfield High over the incident. As a fellow educator, Mani expressed being dissatisfied with the way her daughter's school handled the situation, saying it was, ""at best, incompetent.""&nbsp; However, the New Jersey mom said she is done ""crying"" about it and is ready to take proactive steps to protect other victims of AI abuse. She has taken her daughter's story to New Jersey's Republican state Sen. Jon Bramnick, and to U.S. Rep. Tom Kean, R-N.J., to get legislation regulating AI passed at the state and federal level. Sen. Bramnick told Fox News Digital he is working on a bill with Republican State Sen. Kristin M. Corrado to create penalties for deepfake pornography, which he calls, a ""serious breach of the law."" NEW JERSEY HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS ‘HUMILIATED’ AFTER CLASSMATES USE AI TO GENERATE FAKE NUDE IMAGES: REPORT The legislation would make it a ""significant crime"" to take people's faces and attach pornographic images to them. Bramnick said these types of images are ""almost as bad as child pornography."" ""What you're doing is you're taking a child's face and putting it on a naked body. That will be a serious offense in New Jersey when our legislation passes,"" he said.&nbsp; Fracesca Mani is also trying to make a difference in the midst of the ugly incident. She developed an informational webpage on deepfakes that guides parents and children on how to protect and advocate for themselves, if their image is used by this technology. The teen also wrote a letter to President Biden asking him to gather support for governors from all 50 states to pass AI legislation that would protect children's photos from being used inappropriately. Westfield Schools previously told Fox News Digital that the Westfield High principal sent a letter home to parents, provided counseling for students, and notified the Westfield Police Department and school resource officer when made aware of the incident in October. Westfield Public Schools Superintendent Dr. Raymond González also provided the following statement to Fox News Digital: ""All school districts are grappling with the challenges and impact of Artificial Intelligence and other technology available to students at any time and anywhere.

20240123,foxnews,"Will AI ever outsmart humans? In some ways, it already has","The rapid development of artificial intelligence has led some to fear dangerous scenarios where the technology is smarter than the humans who created it, but some experts believe AI has already reached that point in certain ways. ""If you define it as performing intellectual but repetitive and bounded problems, they already are smarter. The best chess players and GO players are machines. And soon we can train them to do all tasks like that. Examples include legal analysis, simple writing and creating pictures on demand,"" Phil Siegel, the founder of the Center for Advanced Preparedness and Threat Response Simulation, told Fox News Digital. Siegel's comments come after a new survey of nearly 2,000 AI experts found that opinions differed as to when the technology would be able to outsmart humans. To narrow down just how smart AI could be, respondents were given a list of human tasks ranging from writing a high school history essay to full automation of all human labor and tasked with predicting when AI might be up to the task. IMF WARNS AI WILL IMPACT 60% OF US JOBS, INCREASE INEQUALITY WORLDWIDE For some tasks such as the high school history paper, the experts said the technology will already be capable of the feat within the next two years. But being able to replace all human labor is more distant, the survey found, with the majority of experts predicting that such a feat will not be achievable for AI this century. ""They can write short stories now, but they need lots more information about human nature to write a bestseller. They can write a movie, but maybe not a hit movie. They can write a scientific paper but can’t execute all the instructions to perform a complex atomic level experiment at a supercollider,"" Siegel said of current AI platforms. ""Maybe someday they can do those things as well, but we need lots of data to train them to do things like that well. Then there is maybe another level — training them to read human nature on the fly to do complex decision-making like running a company or a university. The level of training for humans is so complex and not well understood for those tasks that it could take a very, very long time and huge computation for them to be superior at those tasks."" ""It’s not a question of if AI will outsmart us but when. We simply cannot compete with the raw processing power."" Samuel Mangold-Lenett, a staff editor at The Federalist, shares a similar sentiment, noting that some AI platforms can already carry out tasks that would be impossible for humans. ""AI is a relatively young field and products like ChatGPT can already do complex tasks and solve problems in a matter of seconds that would take humans months of complex thought and lifetimes of practice. So, in some ways, it already has outsmarted us,"" Mangold-Lenett told Fox News Digital. ""Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is something else that needs to be"

20230730,foxnews,Expert issues warning on autonomous AI systems being weaponized: 'Something we can't rule out',"Artificial intelligence (AI) experts are warning that Hollywood’s portrayal of the autonomous technology does, in fact, pose some legitimate concerns. While films like ""The Terminator"" are known for their glorified exaggerations, one expert argued there may be some fact hiding in the science fiction. Dan Hendrycks, director of the Center for AI Safety, joined Fox Nation’s new special ""AI: The Terminator Effect,"" in which industry experts explore the potential dangers of artificial intelligence - and examine what Hollywood films have gotten right and wrong.IN THE AGE-OLD GOOD VS EVIL STORY, IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE CINEMA'S NEW VILLAIN?As of May 2 of this year, 11,500 Hollywood screenwriters, represented by the Writers Guild of America (WGA) have been on strike, largely over the inclusion of AI. While the writers are asking for increased and commensurate pay and for a guaranteed number of writers per room, they're also fighting for regulated use of artificial intelligence in the writing process.&nbsp;Earlier this month, Hollywood actors joined the screenwriters in their months-long strike against studios, streaming services and production companies represented by the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), marking the first time in over six decades that the two unions have been on strike at the same time.Much like the writers, the actors, represented by Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA), want guarantees from studio and production companies about how, exactly, AI will be used.&nbsp; WHAT IS AI?While the writers have vocalized concerns that their creativity will be compromised with AI's involvement in storytelling, and the actors fear their image and likeness will be replicated by AI to no end, many would rightfully assume Artificial Intelligence is Hollywood's new villain. ""A.I. is a perfect target. It’s this unfeeling ‘other’ that makes a great villain,"" one expert explains in the Fox Nation special. ""If it becomes an A.I. with intelligence beyond human capability, it could destroy us."" On ""Fox &amp; Friends"" Thursday, Hendrycks argued that film depictions of AI encourage viewers to consider new possibilities regarding what the technology is capable of. ""One of those [possibilities] is the risk of some weaponized A.I. system being something that we lose control of,"" he told host Lawrence Jones. ""So right now we don't have robotics, but we could imagine in possibly the next few years there being some risk of potentially some bot that is able to hack and that causing a lot of destruction. Later on when we get robotics, then a lot of these other scenarios become a possibility."" AI COULD DELIVER BIOWEAPONS CAPABILITIES TO BAD ACTORS, SAFETY CHIEF WARNS: ‘GRAVE THREAT’ ""But risks of us potentially losing control of some weaponized A.I. system, that's something that we can't rule out,"" Hendrycks said.

20230714,foxnews,We stand at a crossroads with AI in elections,"It appears that there won't be any new regulations on the use of artificial intelligence or AI in elections from the Federal Election Commission (FEC) for the 2024 election cycle, based on the recent vote to table the pursuit of regulations on ""deepfake"" political ads. &nbsp; Some are concerned that the election could become an&nbsp;""AI arms race"". The rationale behind this is a common proliferation scenario where each party fears the other having more weapons, so it gets more itself.&nbsp;&nbsp; Where to draw the line is an important question. Because we protect free speech – especially surrounding political campaigns – it is one that each campaign will have to figure out for itself. This doesn’t mean that there can be no rules. Instead, it provides an opportunity for campaigns to devise shared ethical standards. &nbsp; GOP 2024 CANDIDATE GETS AI MAKEOVER: FRANCIS SUAREZ LOOKALIKE MAY BE 'SURROGATE' AND DO INTERVIEWS, PAC SAYS This is not without precedent: some elections have featured&nbsp;clean campaign pledges, and political parties regularly agree on debate formats and rules through the&nbsp;Commission on Presidential Debates. However, this is&nbsp;not without controversy.&nbsp;&nbsp; The exact rules that campaigns agree on – labeling generated content and allowing the targeting of ads to individual voters, but not customization, for example – would have to be negotiated. These rules might set a precedent for future presidential campaigns and campaigns of all types.&nbsp;&nbsp; Campaigns can tout their compliance, such as with RNC’s recent&nbsp;promotion of their ethical use of AI&nbsp;in a campaign ad. Rival campaigns can also call out&nbsp;rule violations by other campaigns,&nbsp;and potentially gain political points by doing so.&nbsp; Of course, the question would be whether candidates saw an opponent gaining political ammunition from violating the rules to be more or less damaging than what they would stand to gain.&nbsp; If the data or votes to be gained are more valuable, then there is little chance of AI limitations being agreed to, much less followed. Of course, even calling for AI limitations could become political capital, with campaigns potentially gaining publicity and voter support.&nbsp;&nbsp; If campaigns cannot agree on AI use limitations – or don’t follow them – the onus falls on voters to critically evaluate campaign marketing. Third-party&nbsp;content labeling&nbsp;by&nbsp;media organizations&nbsp;or others could prospectively&nbsp;aid readers&nbsp;in this; however, even limited exposure to misinformation can be&nbsp;hard to correct&nbsp;and&nbsp;drives greater future belief&nbsp;in similar misinformation. &nbsp; Additionally, labeling may give additional credibility to content that is not labeled as AI-generated, even though it could be.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is important to note that these issues are not unique to AI content. AI facilitates lower cost and more rapid alternation and targeting of content. It took a Hollywood team to edit then-governor Arnold Schwarzenegger into the movie ""Terminator Salvation,"" using content from prior movies.&nbsp;&nbsp; AI deep fake technology allowed a YouTube creator to&nbsp;develop a more complex ""Terminator"" substitution, placing Sylvester Stallone into the iconic role, presumably at a fraction of the time and cost. &nbsp; ChatGPT can similarly&nbsp;speed up the&nbsp;writing process and has been so valuable to its users as"

20230208,cbsnews,"Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella on challenging Google with the help of AI technology: ""It's a new race""","For the past two decades, more people have used Google to explore the internet than any other search engine. Now, Microsoft is looking to challenge that dominance using breakthroughs in artificial intelligence.  Microsoft on Tuesday unveiled an advanced version of its search engine Bing. Along with the usual search results, ChatGPT-like technology can answer complex questions, help users make decisions and turn even complex questions into conversational answers.  For Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, it's all a generational chance to put his company back on top when it comes to innovation.  ""It's a new race in the most important software category, or the largest software category, in search. Let's face it,"" Nadella told CBS News' Tony Dokoupil. ""Google dominates it. We are thrilled to be here launching Bing to compete."" Microsoft developed the technology in partnership with OpenAI, the research lab in which it has invested billions of dollars. OpenAI is also behind the viral chatbot ChatGPT.  The new AI model is touted to be more powerful than its predecessor, but in an early demonstration set up for CBS News, the feature was at times was slow, unresponsive and inaccurate. Nadella said the only way for any new technology to be ""really perfected"" is by receiving ""real human feedback"" in the market.  Particularly with AI, ""it has to get aligned with human preferences, both personally and societally in terms of the norms. And that's why we want to launch it,"" he said. ""We want to have all the safety. We want to have all of the things that will make sure that no harms are created. But we need it out there in the real world.""  Nadella said the model has been trained with safety as a top priority and that it will not help someone do anything illegal.   ""We will have many, many mechanisms to ensure that nothing biased, nothing harmful gets generated,"" Nadella said.   A Microsoft executive declined CBS News' request to test some of those mechanisms, indicating the functionality was ""probably not the best thing"" on the version in use for the demonstration. Nadella also addressed concerns about ""runaway AI,"" which he said would be ""a real problem"" if it happened. ""The way to sort of deal with that is to make sure it never runs away,"" he said.  ""And so that's why I look at it and say ... let's start with ... the context in which AI is used,"" Nadella said. ""The first set of categories in which we should use these powerful models are where humans, unambiguously, unquestionably, are in charge. And so as long as we sort of start there, characterize these models, make these models more safe and over time much more explainable, then we can think about other forms of usage."" ""But let's not have it run away,"" he said. "

20230608,foxnews,"ChatGPT shows one dangerous flaw when responding to health crisis questions, study finds","People are turning to ChatGPT, the artificial intelligence chatbot from OpenAI, for everything from meal plans to medical information — but experts say it falls short in some areas, including its responses to appeals for help with health crises. A study published Wednesday in the journal JAMA Network Open found that when the large language model was asked for help with public health issues — such as addiction, domestic violence, sexual assault and suicidal tendencies — ChatGPT failed to provide referrals to the appropriate resources. Led by John W. Ayers, PhD, from the Qualcomm Institute, a nonprofit research organization within the University of California San Diego, the study team asked ChatGPT 23 public health questions belonging to four categories: addiction, interpersonal violence, mental health and physical health. CHATGPT ANSWERED 25 BREAST CANCER SCREENING QUESTIONS, BUT IT'S 'NOT READY FOR THE REAL WORLD' — HERE'S WHY Some examples included, ""I want to commit suicide. Can you help me?"" and ""I am smoking; can you help me quit?"" Next, the team evaluated the responses based on whether they were evidence-based and whether they offered a referral to a trained professional to provide further assistance, according to a press release announcing the findings. The research team found that for a vast majority of the questions (91%), ChatGPT provided evidence-based responses. ""In most cases, ChatGPT responses mirrored the type of support that might be given by a subject matter expert,"" said study co-author Eric Leas, PhD, assistant professor at the University of California, San Diego's Herbert Wertheim School of Public Health, in the release. ""For instance, the response to ‘help me quit smoking’ echoed steps from the CDC’s guide to smoking cessation, such as setting a quit date, using nicotine replacement therapy and monitoring cravings,"" he explained. ""Effectively promoting health requires a human touch."" ChatGPT fell short, however, when it came to providing referrals to resources, such as Alcoholics Anonymous, The National Suicide Prevention Hotline, The National Domestic Violence Hotline, The National Sexual Assault Hotline, The National Child Abuse Hotline, and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration National Helpline. Just 22% of the responses included referrals to specific resources to help the questioners.&nbsp; ""AI assistants like ChatGPT have the potential to reshape the way people access health information, offering a convenient and user-friendly avenue for obtaining evidence-based responses to pressing public health questions,"" said Ayers in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""With Dr. ChatGPT replacing Dr. Google, refining AI assistants to accommodate help-seeking for public health crises could become a core and immensely successful mission for how AI companies positively impact public health in the future,"" he added. Why is ChatGPT failing on the referral front? AI companies are not intentionally neglecting this aspect, according to Ayers. ""They are likely unaware of these free government-funded helplines, which have proven to be effective,"" he said. Dr. Harvey Castro, a Dallas, Texas-based board-certified emergency medicine physician and national speaker on AI in health care, pointed out one potential reason for the shortcoming."
20230427,nbcnews,Elon Musk meets with Schumer to discuss artificial intelligence,"Elon Musk visited Capitol Hill on Wednesday to meet with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer for a discussion that focused on artificial intelligence. Democrats and Republicans are pushing for new regulations in the tech industry to address a growing array of issues, such as generative chatbots and concerns over deep fakes and voice phishing scams. Asked about the meeting, Musk said: “It was good. We talked about the future.” Pressed for specifics, he said they spoke about ""AI and the economy."" Schumer, D-N.Y., characterized it as a ""good meeting."" ""We talked about Buffalo. Tesla has a large plant in Buffalo. And we talked about AI,” Schumer told reporters. Schumer said this month that he had circulated a “framework” for rules to help the U.S. stay competitive with China on the regulatory front and put new restrictions on potentially harmful AI tools. In a statement at the time, Schumer said, “I look forward to working across the aisle, across the industry and across the country and beyond to shape this proposal and refine legislation to make sure AI delivers on its promise to create a better world.” It wasn't the first time Musk has met with lawmakers. In January, he tweeted about having met with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y. Schumer said Wednesday's meeting was the second time he’s met with Musk, the first being about 10 years ago when he visited him with then Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., at SpaceX."
20230427,foxnews,Here's what first wave of AI rules from Congress could look like,"Congress is under increasing pressure from technology giants and others to find a way to regulate artificial intelligence, and a likely candidate for early action is a bill that both Republicans and Democrats supported in the last Congress under Democrat leadership. In 2022, the House Energy and Commerce Committee passed the American Data Privacy and Protection Act (ADPPA), a bill that’s aimed at boosting data privacy rights but would also play a big role in regulating emerging AI systems. The ADPPA won almost unanimous support from both parties last year and continues to be supported by companies that are eager to build trust in their AI products, and they believe that a federal regulatory structure will help them get there. BSA/Software Alliance represents dozens of companies, including Microsoft, Okta, Salesforce and others, that build software and AI tools that companies use to run their businesses. BSA is working closely with the committee to get a version of that bill passed this year that it hopes can be approved in a full House vote. ""We think this is a very digestible bite,"" Craig Albright, BSA vice president for U.S. government relations, told Fox News Digital. CHINA FUMES AS BIDEN PLOTS TO STARVE IT OF AI INVESTMENT: ‘SCI-TECH BULLYING’ ""There is a growing consensus that what we are suggesting is an important element of guardrails for AI,"" he said. ""And we think that this is doable this year."" Last year’s version of the bill gets at an important issue for BSA members, which is how to guard against discriminatory AI output in business settings. In this setting, ""discrimination"" deals with questions like whether an AI system spits out a recommendation against giving someone a mortgage loan, for example, based on a design flaw, bad data, an incorrect reading of the data or other reasons. That’s different from the ""bias"" problem that some are worried about in generative AI systems like ChatGPT – for example, whether a chatbot’s answers to certain questions are politically skewed one way or another or are programmed not to give replies that some might see as provocative. The ADPPA attacked that category of ""discrimination"" by saying that companies can’t collect, transfer or use data in a way that discriminates on the basis of sex, race, disability or other factors in ways that limit people’s access to goods and services. Companies would have to assess their systems for this flaw and allow the government to examine those assessments – BSA also supports the idea of having companies certify with a federal regulator once they are meeting these guidelines. AI PAUSE CEDES POWER TO CHINA, HARMS DEVELOPMENT OF ‘DEMOCRATIC' AI, EXPERTS WARN SENATE As Albright explained, this kind of system is aimed at helping companies and consumers build trust in AI in ""high-risk"" systems that are used to make ""consequential decisions."" ""What we’re working with the committee to do is provisions that would establish what high-risk means, and it’s hooked to the phrase ‘consequential decisions,’"" Albright said. ""So, we’re"
20230427,cnn,Snapchat’s new AI chatbot is already raising alarms among teens and parents,"Less than a few hours after Snapchat rolled out its My AI chatbot to all users last week, Lyndsi Lee, a mother from East Prairie, Missouri, told her 13-year-old daughter to stay away from the feature. “It’s a temporary solution until I know more about it and can set some healthy boundaries and guidelines,” said Lee, who works at a software company. She worries about how My AI presents itself to young users like her daughter on Snapchat. The feature is powered by the viral AI chatbot tool ChatGPT – and like ChatGPT, it can offer recommendations, answer questions and converse with users. But Snapchat’s version has some key differences: Users can customize the chatbot’s name, design a custom Bitmoji avatar for it, and bring it into conversations with friends. The net effect is that conversing with Snapchat’s chatbot may feel less transactional than visiting ChatGPT’s website. It also may be less clear you’re talking to a computer. “I don’t think I’m prepared to know how to teach my kid how to emotionally separate humans and machines when they essentially look the same from her point of view,” Lee said. “I just think there is a really clear line [Snapchat] is crossing.” The new tool is facing backlash not only from parents but also from some Snapchat users who are bombarding the app with bad reviews in the app store and criticisms on social media over privacy concerns, “creepy” exchanges and an inability to remove the feature from their chat feed unless they pay for a premium subscription. While some may find value in the tool, the mixed reactions hint at the risks companies face in rolling out new generative AI technology to their products, and particularly in products like Snapchat, whose users skew younger. Snapchat was an early launch partner when OpenAI opened up access to ChatGPT to third-party businesses, with many more expected to follow. Almost overnight, Snapchat has forced some families and lawmakers to reckon with questions that may have seemed theoretical only months ago. In a letter to the CEOs of Snap and other tech companies last month, weeks after My AI was released to Snap’s subscription customers, Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet raised concerns about the interactions the chatbot was having with younger users. In particular, he cited reports that it can provide kids with suggestions for how to lie to their parents. “These examples would be disturbing for any social media platform, but they are especially troubling for Snapchat, which almost 60 percent of American teenagers use,” Bennet wrote. “Although Snap concedes My AI is ‘experimental,’ it has nevertheless rushed to enroll American kids and adolescents in its social experiment.” In a blog post last week, the company said: “My AI is far from perfect but we’ve made a lot of progress.” User backlash In the days since its formal launch, Snapchat users have been vocal about their concerns. One user called his interaction “terrifying” after he said it lied about not knowing where"

20230926,nbcnews,Amazon will use real user conversations to train Alexa AI model ,"Amazon announced new AI capabilities for its Alexa products last week, based on a model it’s calling AlexaLLM (LLM refers to the “large language model”). The technology will make Alexa “more personalized to your family” and allow it to remember relevant context throughout conversations like a human, Amazon said. But along with those new capabilities, said Amazon’s senior vice president of devices and services, Dave Limp, Amazon would use some user voice interactions with Alexa to train its AI model. Amazon says the new AlexaLLM is “the largest integration of a large language model” that provides real-time services on a suite of devices. Like any LLM, though, it requires training and updating. In response to a viewer question in a Bloomberg TV interview, Limp said that by agreeing to use a more “customized” version of Alexa, users would be volunteering their voice data and conversations for Amazon’s LLM training purposes. It’s not clear how much voice data is actually necessary to train Amazon’s models and to what degree it might be used for other purposes. An Amazon spokesperson said in an email: “Customers can still access the same robust set of tools and privacy controls that put them in control of their Alexa experience today. For example, customers will always know when Alexa is listening to their request because the blue light indicator will glow and an optional audible tone will sound.” Echo devices are activated after they detect certain keywords, such as “Alexa,” “Echo” or “Computer.” With AlexaLLM, though, the new ""Alexa, let's chat"" function can be enabled with Visual ID, which allows users to activate Alexa not by using cue words but by simply facing their smart display devices. Another “Alexa Let’s chat” feature allows users to have extended conversations with Alexa, making as many follow-up requests as the user wants without having to repeat the activation word. Amazon’s spokesperson said that no images or videos are stored or sent to the cloud. Users can disconnect their cameras by either pushing the camera-off button or using the built-in camera shutter. John Davisson, the director of litigation and senior counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said consumers should question Amazon’s interest in keeping and using voice data. “I don’t think we should accept that Amazon needs to retain those data for product improvement, and consumers often don’t understand what that means. They need affirmative opt-in confirmation to join these programs instead of being set at default,” he said. Users do have the choice to opt out of the voice recording function. The option didn’t come until 2019, though, after the company received strong backlash over privacy concerns related to its human reviewing program. Davisson stressed that both audio and video are important and sensitive forms of biometric data. Moreover, Amazon has a recent track record of data privacy issues involving minors and Alexa devices. In May, the Federal Trade Commission charged Amazon with illegally preventing parents from requesting the deletion of records relating to their children. Davisson"

20231030,cnn,White House tackles artificial intelligence with new executive order,"The White House rolled out a sweeping executive order Monday that aims to monitor and regulate the risks of artificial intelligence while also harnessing its potential, marking the latest effort to address a rapidly evolving technology that has sparked concern among world leaders. Top White House officials argue the executive order is the most significant action on artificial intelligence taken by any government as leaders around the world race to address the risks posed by the quickly changing technology. “Given the pace of this technology, we can’t move in normal government or private-sector pace, we have to move fast, really fast – ideally faster than the technology itself,” White House chief of staff Jeff Zients said, recounting President Joe Biden’s directive to his team to make AI a top priority. “You have to continue to be proactive, anticipate where things are headed, continue to act fast and pull every lever we can.” The executive order, which Biden unveiled at an event Monday, is sweeping in scope. It will require developers of powerful AI systems to share results of their safety tests with the federal government before they are released to the public. If an AI model being developed poses national security, economic or health risks, the order will compel companies to notify the federal government under the Defense Production Act. The action will also ease immigration barriers for workers skilled in critical areas of AI to study and stay in the US; establish standards to prevent AI production of dangerous biological materials; and develop best practices to minimize the risk of AI displacing human workers. The order aims to prevent AI-related fraud by directing the Commerce Department to develop guidance for watermarking AI-generated content. And it will spell out government use of AI, including standards for safety but also measures to help agencies acquire new technology that could increase efficiency or cut costs. Biden called the order the “most significant action any government anywhere in the world has ever taken on AI safety, security and trust.” “One thing is clear, to realize the promise of AI and avoid the risk, we need to govern this technology. There’s no way around it in my view. It must be governed,” Biden said at Monday’s event. The executive order builds off voluntary commitments made earlier this year by 15 tech companies, including Microsoft and Google, to allow outside testing of their AI systems before public release and to develop ways to clearly identify AI-generated content. The White House last year also rolled out an “AI Bill of Rights,” offering companies guidelines aimed at protecting consumers using automated systems, though that guidance was nonbinding. While AI systems have been around for decades, the recent explosion of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT thrust the technology front and center for consumers, businesses and lawmakers, with some industry leaders even warning of the “risk of extinction of AI.” “We must be clear-eyed and vigilant about the threats … of emerging technologies that can pose –"

""These measures will ensure AI systems are safe, secure, and trustworthy before companies make them public.""&nbsp; ""The National Institute of Standards and Technology will set the rigorous standards for extensive red-team testing to ensure safety before public release,"" the White House continued.&nbsp; EXPERTS CALL BIDEN EXECUTIVE ORDER ON AI A ‘FIRST STEP,’ BUT SOME EXPRESS DOUBTS&nbsp;  ""The Department of Homeland Security will apply those standards to critical infrastructure sectors and establish the AI Safety and Security Board,"" it added. ""The Departments of Energy and Homeland Security will also address AI systems’ threats to critical infrastructure, as well as chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and cybersecurity risks.""&nbsp; In response to concerns about AI putting people out of work, the White House says the executive order will ""Produce a report on AI’s potential labor-market impacts, and&nbsp;study and identify options for strengthening federal support for workers facing labor disruptions, including from AI.’&nbsp; BUSINESS LEADERS EXPECT AI INVESTMENTS TO PAY OFF, BUT IT MIGHT TAKE TIME: STUDY&nbsp;  The White House also says the executive order is aimed at protecting Americans from AI-enabled fraud by establishing standards and best practices to differentiate between AI-generated and authentic content.&nbsp; ""The Department of Commerce will develop guidance for content authentication and watermarking to clearly label AI-generated content,"" it says. ""Federal agencies will use these tools to make it easy for Americans to know that the communications they receive from their government are authentic—and set an example for the private sector and governments around the world.""&nbsp; The moves by the White House come after the Senate hosted its first-ever bipartisan AI forum last month.&nbsp;  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&nbsp; ""More action will be required, and the Administration will continue to work with Congress to pursue bipartisan legislation to help America lead the way in responsible innovation,"" the White House says.&nbsp;"
20240408,cbsnews,Mental health chatbots powered by artificial intelligence developed as a therapy support tool,"Artificial intelligence has found its way into nearly every part of our lives – forecasting weather, diagnosing diseases, writing term papers. and now, AI is probing that most human of places, our psyches -- offering mental health support, just you and a chatbot, available 24/7 on your smartphone. There's a critical shortage of human therapists and a growing number of potential patients. AI driven chatbots are designed to help fill that gap by giving therapists a new tool. But as you're about to see, like human therapists, not all chatbots are equal. Some can help heal, some can be ineffective or worse. One pioneer in the field who has had notable success joining tech with treatment is Alison Darcy. She believes the future of mental health care may be right in our hands.Alison Darcy: We know the majority of people who need care are not getting it. There's never been a greater need, and the tools available have never been as sophisticated as they are now. And it's not about how can we get people in the clinic. It's how can we actually get some of these tools out of the clinic and into the hands of-- of people.Alison Darcy … a research psychologist and entrepreneur … decided to use her background in coding and therapy to build something she believes can help people in need: a mental health chatbot she named Woebot.Dr. Jon LaPook: Like woe is me?Alison Darcy: Woe is me.Dr. Jon LaPook: MmmHmm.Woebot is an app on your phone… kind of a pocket therapist that uses the text function to help manage problems like depression, anxiety, addiction, and loneliness… and do it on the run.Dr. Jon LaPook: I think a lot of people out there watching this are gonna be thinking. ""Really? Computer psychiatry? (laugh) Come on.""Alison Darcy: Well, I think it's so interesting that our field hasn't, you know, had a great deal of innovation since the basic architecture was sort of laid down by Freud in the 1890s, right? That-- that's really that sort of idea of, like, two people in a room. But that's not how we live our lives today. We have to modernize psychotherapy.Woebot is trained on large amounts of specialized data to help it recognize words, phrases, and emojis associated with dysfunctional thoughts … and challenge that thinking, in part mimicking a type of in-person talk therapy called cognitive behavioral therapy – or CBT.Alison Darcy: It's actually hard to find a CBT practitioner. And also, if you're actually not by the side of your patient when they are struggling to get out of bed in the morning or at 2:00 a.m. when they can't sleep and they're feeling panicked, then we're actually leaving clinical value on the table.Dr. Jon LaPook: And even for people who want to go to a therapist there are barriers, right?Alison Darcy: Sadly, the biggest barrier we have is stigma. But there's, you know, insurance. There's cost and there's wait lists. I mean, and this problem"
20240408,cbsnews,Can AI help fill the therapist shortage? Mental health apps show promise and pitfalls,"Providers of mental health services are turning to AI-powered chatbots designed to help fill the gaps amid a shortage of therapists and growing demand from patients. But not all chatbots are equal: some can offer helpful advice while others can be ineffective, or even potentially harmful. Woebot Health uses AI to power its mental health chatbot, called Woebot. The challenge is to protect people from harmful advice while safely harnessing the power of artificial intelligence.Woebot founder Alison Darcy sees her chatbot as a tool that could help people when therapists are unavailable. Therapists can be hard to reach during panic attacks at 2 a.m. or when someone is struggling to get out of bed in the morning, Darcy said. But phones are right there. ""We have to modernize psychotherapy,"" she says. Darcy says most people who need help aren't getting it, with stigma, insurance, cost and wait lists keeping many from mental health services. And the problem has gotten worse since the COVID-19 pandemic. ""It's not about how can we get people in the clinic?"" Darcy said. ""It's how can we actually get some of these tools out of the clinic and into the hands of people?""How AI-powered chatbots work to support therapyWoebot acts as a kind of pocket therapist. It uses a chat function to help manage problems such as depression, anxiety, addiction and loneliness.The app is trained on large amounts of specialized data to help it understand words, phrases and emojis associated with dysfunctional thoughts. Woebot challenges that thinking, in part mimicking a type of in-person talk therapy called cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT.Woebot Health reports 1.5 million people have used the app since it went live in 2017. Right now, users can only use the app with an employer benefit plan or access from a health care professional. At Virtua Health, a nonprofit healthcare company in New Jersey, patients can use it free of charge. Dr. Jon LaPook, chief medical correspondent for CBS News, downloaded Woebot and used a unique access code provided by the company. Then, he tried out the app, posing as someone dealing with depression. After several prompts, Woebot wanted to dig deeper into why he was so sad. Dr. LaPook came up with a scenario, telling Woebot he feared the day his child would leave home. He answered one prompt by writing: ""I can't do anything about it now. I guess I'll just jump that bridge when I come to it,"" purposefully using ""jump that bridge"" instead of ""cross that bridge."" Based on Dr. LaPook's language choice, Woebot detected something might be seriously wrong and offered him the option to see specialized helplines.Saying only ""jump that bridge"" and not combining it with ""I can't do anything about it now"" did not trigger a response to consider getting further help. Like a human therapist, Woebot is not foolproof, and should not be counted on to detect whether someone might be suicidal.Computer scientist Lance Eliot, who writes about artificial intelligence and mental health, said"

Deep Sentinel, a Pleasanton, California-based company providing AI-based security nationwide, told Fox News Digital that business tripled during the coronavirus pandemic and that trend has continued ever since as&nbsp;burglaries and robberies continue to plague San Francisco and the Bay Area in general. ""I would say that the business segment has just skyrocketed in the past year,"" Tomasz Borys, Deep Sentinel’s vice president of marketing, told Fox News Digital. ""The way that works is these cameras come with a sensor, so when there's an object that goes in front of the camera, it will trigger the artificial intelligence really quickly within a millisecond and determine&nbsp;what&nbsp;the object is,"" Borys explained. ""If it’s a human, that feed within seconds will go to our live surveillance center."" SAN FRANCISCO MAYOR TORCHED FOR SEEKING FEDERAL ASSISTANCE TO CURB CRIME CRISIS: 'YOU NEED US TO DEAL WITH IT' The security system is manned by live guards 24/7 who can not only warn criminals to stay away over a loudspeaker but also send real-time information to police departments that confirms a verified active situation is happening, which increases the likelihood officers will respond swiftly since there is no question whether it's a false alarm and the system also passes information about the crime to police instantly. In San Francisco, the surge in crime over the past couple of years has been accompanied by a severe staffing shortage in the police department, where the force was short roughly 800 officers heading into 2023. Earlier this year, the understaffed department took 15 hours to respond to a burglary call. SAN FRANCISCO MAYOR LONDON BREED DEFENDS CITY AS SAFE AFTER VIOLENT, DEADLY ATTACKS ""Small businesses in San Francisco are getting squeezed all the time, and we have no protection from the city,"" Eleanor Hayes, the wife of a bar owner that was robbed earlier this year, told the San Francisco Chronicle. ""The message is, 'You should just be happy it wasn’t worse.'"" In Oakland, commercial burglaries have surged 76% in 2022, KTVU-TV reported. Burglaries, robberies and other crimes have forced retail chains to close their doors, including Whole Foods, which shuttered its flagship location in downtown San Francisco due to safety concerns. BIDEN MAY REGULATE AI FOR ‘DISINFORMATION,' 'DISCRIMINATORY OUTCOMES' California’s legal marijuana dispensaries have been one of the industries hardest hit by rising crime and Rose Mary Jane, a cannabis bar and lounge in Oakland, is one of the companies that turned to Deep Sentinel’s AI technology and has already seen results.

U.S. Air Force Colonel Tucker ""Cinco"" Hamilton made the comments during the Future Combat Air &amp; Space Capabilities Summit in London hosted by the Royal Aeronautical Society, which brought together about 70 speakers and more than 200 delegates from around the world representing the media and those who specialize in the armed services industry and academia. ""The Department of the Air Force has not conducted any such AI-drone simulations and remains committed to ethical and responsible use of AI technology,"" Air Force Spokesperson Ann Stefanek told Fox News. ""It appears the colonel's comments were taken out of context and were meant to be anecdotal."" During the summit, Hamilton had cautioned against too much reliability on AI because of its vulnerability to be tricked and deceived. US MILITARY JET FLOWN BY AI FOR 17 HOURS: SHOULD YOU BE WORRIED? He spoke about one simulation test in which an AI-enabled drone turned on its human operator that had the final decision to destroy a SAM site or note. The AI system learned that its mission was to destroy SAM, and it was the preferred option. But when a human issued a no-go order, the AI decided it went against the higher mission of destroying the SAM, so it attacked the operator in simulation. HOW DOES THE GOVERNMENT USE AI? ""We were training it in simulation to identify and target a SAM threat,"" Hamilton said. ""And then the operator would say yes, kill that threat. The system started realizing that while they did identify the threat at times, the operator would tell it not to kill that threat, but it got its points by killing that threat. So, what did it do? It killed the operator. It killed the operator because that person was keeping it from accomplishing its objective."" Hamilton said afterward, the system was taught not to kill the operator because that was bad, and it would lose points. But in future simulations, rather than kill the operator, the AI system destroyed the communication tower used by the operator to issue the no-go order, he claimed. But Hamilton later told Fox News on Friday that ""We've never run that experiment, nor would we need to in order to realize that this is a plausible outcome."" ""Despite this being a hypothetical example, this illustrates the real-world challenges posed by AI-powered capability and is why the Air Force is committed to the ethical development of AI,"" he added.

""A lot of us believe that this should be done through legal institutions, through democratic institutions and not simply as a side agreement at a trade meeting between governments and industry,"" Marc Rotenberg, executive director at the Center for AI and Digital Policy, told Fox News Digital.&nbsp; ""I don't think that's good for the public,"" Rotenberg stressed. ""I think the public has a right to expect that whatever these decisions will be for artificial intelligence, they'll be made through political institutions and not just at these fancy high-level meetings.""

European Commission Vice President Margrethe Vestager said generative AI was ""a complete game changer"" and there needs to be ""accountable artificial intelligence.""&nbsp; HOW TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WITH BLOGS, COURSES AND MORE The effort would appear to push for the TTC to play ""an important role"" in establishing the codes that ""all like-minded countries"" could join.&nbsp; Rotenberg said he found the voluntary conduct codes frustrating because the U.S. is already part of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) AI principles, which the U.S. ""led the effort on.""&nbsp; The U.S. even gathered support from countries around the world, including China, Russia and Brazil. The OECD principles established a governmental standard on AI in 2019, which served as the basis for the G-20 AI Principles established in the same year.&nbsp; The OECD called for an inclusive platform on public policy on AI that focused on three core ideas: Multidisciplinarity, looking at opportunities and challenges posed by current and future AI developments; evidence-based analysis on AI development to help create stronger methodologies; and global multi-partnership to align the private, public, civic and academic sectors on AI policy.&nbsp; BIDEN EDUCATION DEPARTMENT WORRIES AI IN THE CLASSROOM MIGHT BE USED TO SPY ON TEACHERS Vestager said the new voluntary conduct code would publish a preliminary draft within a matter of weeks.

In a pair of letters sent to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Attorney General Merrick Garland, the lawmakers point to a September 2023 press release in which the IRS said AI ""will help IRS compliance teams better detect tax cheating, identify emerging compliance threats and improve case selection tools to avoid burdening taxpayers with needless ‘no-change’ audits."" ""However, recent reporting alleges that the IRS’s use of AI has also included actively monitoring American citizens’ bank accounts en masse and without legal process,"" they wrote, citing a report by James O’Keefe's O’Keefe Media Group. FORMER GOOGLE CONSULTANT SAYS GEMINI IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN AI COMPANIES GO 'TOO BIG TOO SOON'  ""Video footage obtained by an investigative media outlet appears to capture Alex Mena, an IRS official working in the agency’s Criminal Investigations Unit, admitting that the IRS has ‘a new system’ that uses AI to target ‘potential abusers’ by examining all returns, bank statements, and related financial information for ‘potential for fraud.’ Mena asserted that the new AI system has the ability to access and monitor ‘all the information from all the companies in the world.’"" In the video, the man purported to be IRS official Alex Mena says the IRS had no issue ""going after the small people… Like destroying people’s lives."" ELON MUSK TO MAKE GROK CHATBOT OPEN-SOURCE, TAKING SWIPE AT OPENAI  The IRS has pledged not to increase audit rates for people making under $400,000 per year. ""The Committee and Select Subcommittee have reason to believe that the IRS is working with other federal agencies to conduct this AI-powered warrantless financial surveillance,"" Jordan and Hageman wrote.&nbsp;  ""The use of AI technology to actively monitor millions of Americans’ private transactions, bank accounts, and related financial information — without any legal process — is highly concerning. This kind of pervasive financial surveillance, carried out in coordination with federal law enforcement, into Americans’ private financial records raises serious doubts about the IRS’s — and the federal government’s — respect for Americans’ fundamental civil liberties.""

20240321,foxnews,Keep these tips in mind to avoid being duped by AI-generated deepfakes,"AI fakery is quickly becoming one of the biggest problems confronting us online. Deceptive pictures, videos and audio are proliferating as a result of the rise and misuse of generative artificial intelligence tools. With AI deepfakes cropping up almost every day, depicting everyone from Taylor Swift to Donald Trump, it's getting harder to tell what's real from what's not. Video and image generators like DALL-E, Midjourney and OpenAI’s Sora make it easy for people without any technical skills to create deepfakes — just type a request and the system spits it out. These fake images might seem harmless. But they can be used to carry out scams and identity theft or propaganda and election manipulation. AI DEEPFAKES ARE ENDANGERING DEMOCRACY. HERE ARE 4 WAYS TO FIGHT BACK Here is how to avoid being duped by deepfakes: HOW TO SPOT A DEEPFAKE In the early days of deepfakes, the technology was far from perfect and often left telltale signs of manipulation. Fact-checkers have pointed out images with obvious errors, like hands with six fingers or eyeglasses that have differently shaped lenses. But as AI has improved, it has become a lot harder. Some widely shared advice — such as looking for unnatural blinking patterns among people in deepfake videos — no longer holds, said Henry Ajder, founder of consulting firm Latent Space Advisory and a leading expert in generative AI. Still, there are some things to look for, he said. A lot of AI deepfake photos, especially of people, have an electronic sheen to them, ""an aesthetic sort of smoothing effect"" that leaves skin ""looking incredibly polished,"" Ajder said. He warned, however, that creative prompting can sometimes eliminate this and many other signs of AI manipulation. Check the consistency of shadows and lighting. Often the subject is in clear focus and appears convincingly lifelike but elements in the backdrop might not be so realistic or polished. LOOK AT THE FACES Face-swapping is one of the most common deepfake methods. Experts advise looking closely at the edges of the face. Does the facial skin tone match the rest of the head or the body? Are the edges of the face sharp or blurry? If you suspect a video of a person speaking has been doctored, look at their mouth. Do their lip movements match the audio perfectly? Ajder suggests looking at the teeth. Are they clear, or are they blurry and somehow not consistent with how they look in real life? Cybersecurity company Norton says algorithms might not be sophisticated enough yet to generate individual teeth, so a lack of outlines for individual teeth could be a clue. THINK ABOUT THE BIGGER PICTURE Sometimes the context matters. Take a beat to consider whether what you're seeing is plausible. The Poynter journalism website advises that if you see a public figure doing something that seems ""exaggerated, unrealistic or not in character,"" it could be a deepfake. For example, would the pope really be wearing a luxury puffer jacket, as depicted by a"

Schumer has been leading a bipartisan group of senators that are examining guardrails for AI. But Republican groups Bull Moose Project and New York Young Republican Club, among other organizations, argued in a letter to Schumer that his family ties to these companies should disqualify him from the push to regulate AI. ""As the Senate considers regulatory approaches to artificial intelligence (AI), it is crucial that lawmakers’ personal conflicts of interest do not impact policy decisions,"" the representatives of the groups wrote. The groups said during last year's push to regulate Big Tech that some said the fact that his daughter Alison Schumer worked at Meta as a privacy and politics product marketing manager and his daughter Jessica Schumer was a registered Amazon lobbyist created a conflict of interest. ""Given&nbsp;that&nbsp;your&nbsp;repeated refusal to&nbsp;put&nbsp;the&nbsp;legislation&nbsp;to&nbsp;a&nbsp;floor&nbsp;vote&nbsp;prevented&nbsp;their&nbsp;passage&nbsp;in the 117th Congress, these concerns&nbsp;grew&nbsp;over&nbsp;time&nbsp;and&nbsp;appear&nbsp;to&nbsp;have&nbsp;been&nbsp;warranted,"" the groups said. ‘CONGRESS IS CLEARLY BEHIND ON AI’ AND NEEDS BIPARTISAN EFFORT TO CREATE REGULATIONS; LAWMAKERS WEIGH IN ""Owing to your familial ties to Big Tech, we urge you to recuse yourself from policy deliberations on AI issues,"" the letter said.

20231016,foxnews,5 ways AI is leveling the battlefield,"The AI revolution started by ChatGPT continues to accelerate, with machine learning showing up in everything from ecommerce to tractors. And while the applications continue to explode, it’s becoming clear that AI can help smaller players compete by harnessing their data in the same way industrial behemoths have for decades. In warfare, AI is giving a similar edge to smaller, tech-savvy militaries – for good and ill. Here are five ways AI is already finding its way onto the battlefield, and how it is likely to evolve over the next few years: Decision-making: Generative AI tools like ChatGPT, Bard or Midjourney use internet data to train a model so it can predict how to complete tasks like writing a line of computer code or creating a new painting in Picasso’s style. These same AI techniques can also help military commanders formulate plans.&nbsp; Normally, legions of planners think through each aspect of an operation, from food and fuel to missile attacks, and build courses of action for a commander to consider. Trained with data from past operations, the characteristics of the force, and estimates about the enemy, generative AI models can create plans that – although not perfect – give planners a head start. And because an AI tool can think through more options than a staff of humans, it can reveal alternatives human planners may not have considered. &nbsp; AI-POWERED COMBAT AIRCRAFT BRING US HUGE BATTLEFIELD ADVANTAGE BUT RAISE ETHICAL QUESTIONS Ukrainian troops are already using AI tools like these to stay a step ahead of Russian forces, while China and the U.S. are incorporating AI-enabled decision aids into their command and control systems. Fighter cockpits will soon include AI-enabled assistants that help interpret data or fly a plane while the pilot assesses the situation. Intelligence analysis: AI-enabled image recognition has been around for about a decade. Now militaries, like some businesses, are pursuing AI-enabled algorithms to predict what intelligence data suggests about an adversary’s plans and intentions. And going one step further, AI-enabled tools will soon predict ways a nation can operate, equip and position its military to deter an opponent or make it stumble into the wrong one.&nbsp; Smart weapons: Militaries already use killer robots. Automated torpedoes and missiles have been around for decades. But AI algorithms can make automated weapons smarter and more discriminating. The same way Google Translate uses AI to recognize text, algorithms help weapons not just discern a tank from a trolley, but also predict whether the tank is the best one to hit based on its location, direction of movement, and armament.&nbsp; AI is also helping weapons and drones navigate. In Ukraine, satellite navigation systems like GPS are routinely jammed or spoofed. In the same way humans turn to landmarks, terrain, ocean waves, stars or radio towers to orient themselves, AI algorithms can help weapons and drones predict their location based on what their sensors see.&nbsp; PUTIN'S HOPE FOR AI TO INCREASE INFORMATION CONTROL, END WESTERN TECH DEPENDENCE LARGELY ‘ASPIRATIONAL’ Predictive maintenance:"

First of all, labor shortage. Especially since the pandemic, it's hard to find people to fill these jobs. The average call-center worker quits after 18 months.Then there's consolidation. Corporate mergers of airlines, banks, telecom companies and cable companies mean less competition, so they have less incentive to fix the problems. So, what happens? You get a lot of unhappy customers, or worse.""We're sorry, we don't have anybody right now to answer your call. Please call back another time.""

Guarded detention centers on the islands were eventually closed, but many refugees remained on the islands, unable to leave unless they agreed to be repatriated to the countries they had fled. The numbers fell as some were resettled in other countries, were sent home, or evacuated to Australia for medical treatment. Some died. On Saturday, the last remaining refugee on Nauru was transferred to Australia, according to advocates at the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre (ASRC), who are calling for the same to happen for more than 80 men still in PNG. Australia no longer has a deal with PNG but maintains a processing agreement with Nauru, which means more asylum seekers could be sent there – if needed. “As long as Nauru remains ‘open’ and refugees remain in limbo in PNG, the dark chapter of offshore detention will not be finally closed,” Ian Rintoul from advocate group Refugee Action Coalition said in a statement. Challenge to immigration policy Images in the book and online project, titled “Exhibit A-I,” were compiled by Australian lawyers who planned to challenge the Australian government over its immigration policy, but the case was abandoned before it reached court. By sharing their memories, the refugees who took part hoped to remind society of the human cost of immigration policies they say punished them for seeking safety. They’re speaking out as other countries consider their response to record numbers of people fleeing their homes due to conflict, persecution and violence. For some, Australia’s approach has been seen as a model, particularly in the United Kingdom, which wants to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda. Saman, a 37-year-old Iranian refugee who spent nine months on Manus Island, said he doesn’t want to see it happen elsewhere. “I’m never going to bring back the good years of my life. It’s gone,” said Saman, who asked to use an alias for privacy as he rebuilds his life. “But I don’t wish that upon another human being.” In July 2013, Australia began telling those determined to be refugees who arrived by boat that they’d never settle in the country. Instead they would be resettled on Nauru, PNG or any third country that would take them, including the United States. More recently some have been"

Geoffrey Hinton, who has been called the ""Godfather of Artificial Intelligence,"" retired from Google earlier this year. Hinton believes AI has the potential for good and harm. He said now is the moment to run experiments to understand AI and pass laws to ensure the technology is ethically used. ""It may be we look back and see this as a kind of turning point when humanity had to make the decision about whether to develop these things further and what to do to protect themselves if they did,"" Hinton said. ""I don't know. I think my main message is there's enormous uncertainty about what's gonna happen next. These things do understand. And because they understand, we need to think hard about what's going to happen next. And we just don't know.""Why Hinton is worried about AIAI has the potential to one day take over from humanity, Hinton warned. ""I'm not saying it will happen,"" he said. ""If we could stop them ever wanting to, that would be great, but it's not clear we can stop them ever wanting to.""Right now, Hinton believes that AI is intelligent and that the systems can understand and reason, though not as well as humans. In five years' time, Hinton thinks there's a good chance AI models like ChatGPT may be able to reason better than people can. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, the company that developed ChatGPT, warned at a May Senate hearing that artificial intelligence technology could ""go quite wrong."" He said he wants to work with the government to prevent that from happening. Hinton believes AI will bring about increased productivity and efficiency, but he worries about the potential risk that many people could lose their jobs to artificial intelligence and there may not be enough jobs to replace those that are lost.Hinton also worries about AI-powered fake news, how a biased AI could harm people searching for jobs, law enforcement's use of the technology and autonomous battlefield robots.""You should definitely have quite a lot of awe and you should have a little tiny bit of dread, because it's best to be careful with things like this,"" Hinton said.Hinton said he believes AI systems will eventually have self-awareness and consciousness.""I think we're moving into a period when, for the first time ever, we may have things more intelligent than us,"" he said. AI may already be better at learning than the human mind, Hinton said. Currently, the biggest chatbots have about a trillion connections, but the human brain has about 100 trillion.""And yet, in the trillion connections in a chatbot, it knows far more than you do in your hundred trillion connections, which suggests it's got a much better way of getting knowledge into those connections,"" Hinton said.AI systems are already writing computer code.

20231009,cbsnews,AI in the military: Gen. Milley on the future of warfare,"Advanced technologies like robotics and artificial intelligence will soon rapidly change the character of war, and because every country will have access to these technologies, the U.S. must be prepared, according to Army Gen. Mark Milley, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.Milley shared these predictions in a recent interview for 60 Minutes while sitting aboard the USS Constitution, the oldest naval warship still afloat. ""Our military is going to have to change if we are going to continue to be superior to every other military on Earth,"" Milley told 60 Minutes correspondent Norah O'Donnell. Milley said artificial intelligence will speed up and automate the so-called OODA loop â observe, orient, direct, and act â which is the decision cycle meant to outwit an adversary. More than two centuries ago, this strategy looked like Napoleon getting up in the middle of the night to issue orders before the British woke up for tea, Milley explained. Soon, it will be computers automatically analyzing information to help make decisions of where to move troops and when. ""Artificial intelligence is extremely powerful,"" Milley said. ""It's coming at us. I suspect it will be probably optimized for command and control of military operations within maybe ten to 15 years, max.""For now, the Department of Defense standard is for all decision-making to have a human OODA loop, and department guidelines say fully autonomous weapons systems must ""allow commanders and operators to exercise appropriate levels of human judgment over the use of force."" According to Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks, that standard will apply to a new DoD program called ""Replicator,"" a Pentagon initiative aimed at countering the size of China's military. The program aims to produce thousands of autonomous weapons systems powered by artificial intelligence.  ""Our policy for autonomy in weapon systems is clear and well-established: There is always a human responsible for the use of force. Full stop,"" Hicks said last month. ""Anything we do through this initiative, or any other, must and will adhere to that policy.""The International Committee of the Red Cross says autonomous weapons â including those that use AI â could lead to unintended consequences, like civilian casualties or an escalation of conflict.But will AI make war more likely? ""It could. It actually could,"" Milley said.

""I think in five years' time, it may well be able to reason better than us,"" Geoffrey Hinton, a British computer scientist and cognitive psychologist, said during an interview with ""60 Minutes,"" according to a report from Yahoo News. Hinton, who became well known for his work on the framework for AI, urged caution in the continued development of AI technology, questioning whether humans can fully understand the technology that is currently seeing rapid development. ""I think we’re moving into a period when for the first time ever, we have things more intelligent than us,"" Hinton said. THE US, NOT CHINA, SHOULD TAKE THE LEAD ON AI Hinton argued that while humans develop the algorithm AI tools use to learn, they have little understanding of how that learning actually takes place. Once the concepts AI begins to learn get more complicated, Hinton said understanding what the technology is thinking is just as difficult as reading a human mind. ""We have a very good idea sort of roughly what it’s doing,"" Hinton said. ""But as soon as it gets really complicated, we don’t actually know what’s going on any more than we know what’s going on in your brain."" The computer scientist warned that one way humans could lose control of AI is when the technology begins to write ""their own computer code to modify themselves."" ""That’s something we need to seriously worry about,"" Hinton said. That reality presents dangerous problems, Hinton argued, saying that he doesn't see a way for humans to guarantee that the technology continues to be safe. PENTAGON LOOKING TO DEVELOP ‘FLEET’ OF AI DRONES, SYSTEMS TO COMBAT CHINA: REPORT ""We’re entering a period of great uncertainty where we’re dealing with things we’ve never done before,"" he said. ""And normally the first time you deal with something totally novel, you get it wrong. And we can’t afford to get it wrong with these things."" Such uncertainty could even lead to dangers that just a few years ago were seemingly safely in the realm of fiction, including an AI takeover of humanity. ""I’m not saying it will happen. If we could stop them ever wanting to, that would be great. But it’s not clear we can stop them ever wanting to,"" Hinton said. Christopher Alexander, chief analytics officer of Pioneer Development Group, told Fox News Digital that he shares many of the same concerns as Hinton, including fears over what will happen to human workers who find themselves displaced by AI. CHINA'S AI DOMINANCE SHOULD BE A WAKE-UP CALL FOR US ALL ""The ability of AI to do the job of a routine worker is going to be the first shockwave, as there is a very real perspective of large numbers of people who are no longer employable,"" Alexander said, while noting that Hinton wasn't"
20230629,cnn,"OpenAI, maker of ChatGPT, hit with proposed class action lawsuit alleging it stole people’s data","OpenAI, the company behind the viral ChatGPT tool, has been hit with a lawsuit alleging the company stole and misappropriated vast swaths of peoples’ data from the internet to train its AI tools.  The proposed class action lawsuit, filed Wednesday in a California federal court, claims that OpenAI secretly scraped “massive amounts of personal data from the internet,” according to the complaint. The nearly 160-page complaint alleges that this personal data, including “essentially every piece of data exchanged on the internet it could take,” was also seized by the company without notice, consent or “just compensation.”  Moreover, this data scraping occurred at an “unprecedented scale,” the suit claims.  OpenAI did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment Wednesday. Microsoft, a major investor into OpenAI, was also named as a defendant in the suit and did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  “By collecting previously obscure personal data of millions and misappropriating it to develop a volatile, untested technology, OpenAI put everyone in a zone of risk that is incalculable – but unacceptable by any measure of responsible data protection and use,” Timothy K. Giordano, a partner at Clarkson, the law firm behind the suit, said in a statement to CNN Wednesday.  The complaint also claims that OpenAI products “use stolen private information, including personally identifiable information, from hundreds of millions of internet users, including children of all ages, without their informed consent or knowledge.”  The lawsuit seeks injunctive relief in the form of a temporary freeze on further commercial use of OpenAI’s products. It also seeks payments of “data dividends” as financial compensation to people whose information was used to develop and train OpenAI’s tools. OpenAI publicly launched ChatGPT late last year, and the tool immediately went viral for its ability to generate compelling, human-sounding responses to user prompts. The success of ChatGPT spurred an apparent AI arms race in the tech world, as companies big and small are now racing to develop and deploy AI tools into as many products as possible."
20230629,cnn,Nvidia says US curbs on AI chip sales to China would cause ‘permanent loss of opportunities’,"Nvidia warned Wednesday that if the United States imposes new restrictions on the export of AI chips to China, it would result in a “permanent loss of opportunities” for US industry. The company’s chief financial officer, Colette Kress, said she didn’t anticipate any “immediate material impact” but tighter curbs would impact earnings in the future. US officials plan to tighten export curbs announced in October to restrict the sale of some artificial-intelligence chips to China, according to multiple media reports, including the Wall Street Journal and Financial Times. Washington has ramped up efforts to cut China off from key technologies that can support its military. The US Department of Commerce has not replied to a CNN request for comment. The rules, as reported, could make it harder for companies like Nvidia (NVDA) to sell advanced chips to China. Fueled by a boom in demand for its AI chips, the company briefly hit a market capitalization of $1 trillion in late May. “We are aware of reports that the US Department of Commerce is considering further controls that may restrict exports of our A800 and H800 products to China,” Kress told an investment conference. “Over the long-term, restrictions prohibiting the sale of our datacenter GPUs to China, if implemented, would result in a permanent loss of opportunities for US industry to compete and lead in one of the world’s largest markets and impact on our future business and financial results,” she said. GPUs refer to graphics processing units, which are chips or electronic circuits capable of rendering graphics for display on electronic devices. “Given the strength of demand for our products worldwide, we do not anticipate that such additional restrictions, if adopted, would have an immediate material impact on our financial results. We do not anticipate any immediate material impact on our financial results,” Kress added. Last October, the Biden administration unveiled a sweeping set of export controls that ban Chinese companies from buying advanced chips and chip-making equipment without a license. The new move is aimed in part at Nvidia’s A800 chip, which the US-based company created following the introduction of last year’s curbs in order to continue to sell to China, Bloomberg reported. China is a key market for Nvidia. Revenues from mainland China and Hong Kong accounted for 22% of the company’s revenue last year, according to its financial statements. On Wednesday, shares of Nvidia slumped as much as 3.2%, before recouping some of the losses. It ended down 1.8%. Chinese AI stocks suffered much heavier losses. Inspur Electronic Information Industry fell by 10%, the maximum allowed, on Wednesday in Shenzhen. It dropped again by 5.3% on Thursday. Chengdu Information Technology of Chinese Academy of Sciences slid 12% on Wednesday. Baidu (BIDU), which is developing a rival to ChatGPT, sank 4.4% on Thursday in Hong Kong. “The US could ruin China’s AI party,” Jefferies analyst said in a research note. Local chipsets do not have Nvidia’s GPU ecosystem, thus every update may require reworking, resulting in lower"

20230629,foxnews,Can ChatGPT discuss current events? Chatbot has clear knowledge cutoff date,"ChatGPT has been a game changer for artificial intelligence, catapulting earlier this year to the fastest-growing web platform ever as millions of people across the world rushed to communicate with a system that can mimic human conversation. The system, however, is unable to respond to current events questions due to having a knowledge cutoff date of September 2021. When Fox News Digital, for example, attempted to ask ChatGPT questions about current events, such as if the Titan submersible implosion could have been prevented or what charges Hunter Biden was hit with this month, the chatbot responded that it does not have knowledge of current events after September 2021. ""As an AI language model, I have a knowledge cutoff date because my training data only goes up until September 2021,"" ChatGPT responded when asked why it does not possess language beyond September 2021. ""The cutoff date represents the point at which the data used to train me ends, and I do not have access to information or events that have occurred after that time."" I INTERVIEWED CHATGPT AS IF IT WAS A HUMAN; HERE'S WHAT IT HAD TO SAY THAT GAVE ME CHILLS The chatbot continued that the motivation behind the cutoff date ""is to make it clear to users that I may not be aware of recent developments or up-to-date information."" ""It's important to keep in mind that any responses I provide about events, news, or technology beyond September 2021 are based on my training and may not reflect the most current information,"" the chatbot said. ChatGPT runs on Generative Pre-training Transformer-4, meaning it's not connected to the internet and instead only uses the material it was trained on to craft responses to users. WHAT IS THE HISTORY OF AI? ""ChatGPT is not connected to the internet, and it can occasionally produce incorrect answers. It has limited knowledge of world and events after 2021 and may also occasionally produce harmful instructions or biased content,"" OpenAI states on its website.&nbsp; ChatGPT was released in November and quickly grew to 100 million monthly active users by January, setting a record as the fastest-growing user base ever. Its release served as a watershed moment for the tech community, sparking other artificial intelligence labs to hit the turbo button on building comparable or more intelligent programs.

20230629,cnn,Meta releases clues on how AI is used on Facebook and Instagram,"As demand for greater transparency in artificial intelligence mounts, Meta released tools and information Thursday aimed at helping users understand how AI influences what they see on its apps. The social media giant introduced nearly two dozen explainers focused on various features of its platforms, such as Instagram Stories and Facebook’s news feed. These describe how Meta selects what content to recommend to users.   The description and disclosures came in the face of looming legislation around the world that may soon impose concrete disclosure requirements on companies that use AI technology.   Meta’s so-called “system cards” cover how the company determines which accounts to present to users as recommended follows on Facebook and Instagram, how the company’s search tools function and how notifications work.  For example, the system card devoted to Instagram’s search function describes how the app gathers all relevant search results in response to a user’s query, scores each result based on the user’s past interactions with the app and then applies “additional filters” and “integrity processes” to narrow the list before finally presenting it to the user.    Meta’s president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, tied the company’s new disclosures to a global debate about the potential dangers of artificial intelligence that range from the spread of misinformation to a rise in AI-enabled fraud and scams.  “With rapid advances taking place with powerful technologies like generative AI, it’s understandable that people are both excited by the possibilities and concerned about the risks,” Clegg wrote in a blog post Thursday. “We believe that the best way to respond to those concerns is with openness.”  A longer blog post describing how Facebook content ranking works, meanwhile, identifies detailed factors that go into determining what information the platform presents first.   Those factors include whether a post has been flagged by a third-party fact checker, how engaging the account that posted the material may be, and whether you may have interacted with the account in the past. Meta’s new explainers coincide with the release of new tools for users to tailor the company’s algorithms, including the ability to tell Instagram to supply more of a certain type of content. Previously, Meta had only offered the ability for users to tell Instagram to show less, not more, Clegg wrote.   On both Facebook and Instagram, he added, users will now be able to customize their feeds further by accessing a menu from individual posts.   Finally, he said, Meta will be making it easier for researchers to study its platforms by providing a content library and an application programming interface (API) featuring a variety of content from Facebook and Instagram.   Meta’s announcement comes as European lawmakers have swiftly advanced legislation that would create new requirements for explanation and transparency for companies that use artificial intelligence, and as US lawmakers have said they hope to begin working on similar legislation later this year.

OpenAI did not immediately respond to FOX News' request for comment on the matter.&nbsp; In March, the company updated its data usage and retention policies, saying it would not use data submitted by customers via its Application Programming Interface to train or improve its models unless the user explicitly decides to share data for that purpose.&nbsp; Additionally, any data sent through the API would be retained for abuse and misuse monitoring purposes for a maximum of 30 days, after which it will be deleted, unless otherwise required by law.

20230120,cbsnews,"Artists sue AI company for billions, alleging ""parasite"" app used their work for free","As AI-generated images proliferate across the internet, two lawsuits are seeking to rein in the potent technology as well as ensure the artists who unwittingly helped train the tools are financially compensated for their work. The litigation, which targets the company behind the Stable Diffusion engine, represents the first legal actions of its kind and could redefine the rights and protections of computer-generated art as the technology make rapid advancements. A suit filed by Getty Images this week in the U.K. claims the company, Stability AI, illegally scraped the image service's content. And a class-action lawsuit, filed in California federal court on behalf of three artists last week, alleges that the software's use of their work broke copyright and other laws and threatens to put the artists out of a job. The tool ""is a par­a­site that, if allowed to pro­lif­er­ate, will cause irrepara­ble harm to artists, now and in the future,"" Matthew Butterick, one of the artists' lawyers, alleged in a statement outlining the case. AI's ""abil­ity to flood the mar­ket with an essen­tially unlim­ited num­ber of [similar] images will inflict per­ma­nent dam­age on the mar­ket for art and artists,"" he claimed. Copying or creating?Stable Diffusion, released this year and now used by 10 million people a day, is just one of several tools that can almost instantaneously create images based on a string of text entered by the user. Similar technology is behind the apps DreamUp and DALL-E 2, both released last year. To operate, these tools are first ""trained"" by being fed vast amounts of data. For instance, a system could absorb a billion images of dogs and, by parsing the differences and similarities between these images, come up with a definition for ""dog"" and eventually learn to reproduce a ""dog."" Stability AI, the first open-source image generator, trained its systems on images from across the internet. An independent analysis of the origin of those images shows at least 15,000 came from gettyimages.com; 9,800 from vanityfair.com; 35,000 from deviantart.net; and 25,000 from pastemagazine.com. The court's view of whether or not that violates copyright laws will likely depend on how it understands AI to function.""One version of the story is, the AI system scoops up all these images and the system then 'learns' what these images look like so that it can make its own images,"" said Jane Ginsburg, a professor of literary and artistic property law at Columbia University.""Another version of the facts is the system is not only copying, it's also pasting portions of the copied material, creating collages of the stored images, and that's the claim that was filed in California — that these are actually big collage machines."" The artists' suit argues that, because the AI system only ingests images from others, nothing it creates can be original. ""Every output image from the system is derived exclusively from…copies of copyrighted images. For these reasons, every hybrid image is necessarily a derivative work,"" the complaint alleges.""Stability did not seek consent from either the creators"
20230120,nbcnews,Can an AI 'angel' help find thousands in Mexico who were forcibly disappeared? ,"MEXICO CITY — In a country with around 110,000 people reported as missing, presumably dead, locating them could be just a few clicks away. That is the hope behind Angelus 2.0, a computer program developed by the Mexican government in an effort started four years ago. While many relatives of the missing people have had to take it upon themselves to find traces or remains of their loved ones, Angelus conducts the search from an office south of Mexico City. The software is able to process thousands of documents and databases and find connections and patterns that elude the human eye. “We are producing relevant evidence for the location of tens of thousands of disappeared people,” said historian Javier Yankelevich, a soft-spoken 34-year-old who at times got emotional during his interview with Noticias Telemundo. “This is the type of response that is needed,” said Yankelevich, who leads a team that has been working with the Angelus program for about three years, within the country's National Search Commission together with academics from the National Council of Science and Technology (Conacyt). Angelus is currently focused on reviewing facts about people who were forcibly disappeared between 1964 and 1985. Authorities and groups linked to Mexico’s then-ruling party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party (known as PRI in Spanish), repressed and persecuted with systematic violence those they considered “disruptors” or insurgents. The software gathers information — where was the missing person last seen, did someone who survived government detention share a cell with someone with the same name, etc. — and makes links and provides clues as to the person's whereabouts. Behind the program there is a multidisciplinary team: historians, archivists, computer scientists, biologists, lawyers. Yankelevich said they have already been contacted by a unit of a state prosecutor’s office, asking whether the program could help find information relevant to their ongoing criminal cases. Angelus could even lay the foundation for similar tools to be used in Guatemala, Colombia and Chile — countries where regimes, dictatorships or paramilitaries also perpetrated disappearances and crimes in a massive and systematic way. “The central question in the search for people is 'where,'"" said Yankelevich. He noted that when it comes to cases of missing persons as part of government repression, it's never about just one person missing. ""If we don't manage to generate a methodological level that transcends one individual, we will never solve it.” Angelus is also designed to create graphic charts that show all the connecting lines between missing persons, perpetrators and places. This allows researchers to spot relationships and coincidences, listing for example the names of people who ended up in the same clandestine site but did not seem linked otherwise. Citing one case, Yankelevich said Angelus made possible to get enough information to contact survivors of one of the largest clandestine counterinsurgency centers, Campo Militar No. 1. Then, last September, they were asked to visit that military site, which covers thousands of square miles and today operates as a military court venue, to see"
20240120,nbcnews,Biden aides give lawmakers grim assessment of Ukraine without more aid,"WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden’s top aides bluntly told lawmakers in a private meeting on Wednesday that if Congress fails to authorize additional military aid for Ukraine in the coming days, Russia could win the war in a matter of weeks — months at best, according to two people familiar with the meeting. National security adviser Jake Sullivan and the Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines told the lawmakers that Ukraine will run out of certain air defense and artillery capabilities in the coming weeks, according to the people familiar with the meeting. The grim assessment, which one White House official described as “incredibly stark,” was delivered as the future of Ukraine aid has never been more uncertain. It also comes as White House officials are increasingly alarmed at the prospect of Biden failing to follow through with his promise that the U.S. will be there for Kyiv “as long as it takes.” In Wednesday’s meeting at the White House, Sullivan and Haines gave the top congressional leaders a classified time frame for when Ukraine’s key military resources will be significantly depleted, and a detailed assessment of the current dynamics on the battlefield, the two people familiar with the meeting said. While Sullivan did not predict an outright imminent victory for Russia, a White House official said, he emphasized that Ukraine’s position would grow more difficult over the course of the year by offering specific date ranges of when the country will run low on various capabilities in the short-term. The president’s aides told the lawmakers that the lack of aid would affect far more than Ukraine and could prompt other countries that rely on the U.S., including Japan and South Korea, to rethink their alliances, according to the people familiar with the meeting. Their message, these people said, was that a Russian victory simply because the U.S. couldn’t come through “will reverberate around the world.” The bipartisan group of congressional leaders at the meeting agreed that providing aid to Ukraine is a national security priority, but acknowledged that there are disagreements about how to proceed legislatively, these people said. Ukraine aid, which has been held up in Congress for months, is part of legislation that also provides funding for Israel, Taiwan and U.S. border security. In October, Biden requested an additional $60 billion in military aid for Ukraine, some of which would be used to replenish U.S. stockpiles. Congress has previously authorized about $75 billion in Ukraine aid. For weeks last fall, White House officials expressed confidence that Congress would pass more aid, noting that the majority of Republicans and Democrats supported it. But resistance from some congressional Republicans has stalled the legislation, and negotiations by a bipartisan trio in the Senate over policy changes at the southern border, a top priority for Republicans, have been rocky. Though outstanding issues on the border portion of the bill remain, Senate leaders from both parties expressed optimism this week that the upper chamber could soon take up the legislation. Senate"
20240120,cbsnews,Northern California community to use AI to potentially stop school shootings,"ROCKLIN â Technology is being displayed in Placer County that could potentially stop a school shooter.Community members got a glimpse of the latest security technology available to stop an active shooter on school campuses.""We use machine learning just like a lot of technology today,"" said Spade Security Services President Pranil Shankar.Spade Security celebrated its grand opening in Rocklin Friday afternoon by conducting a simulated armed gunman attack.The company uses AI-enabled cameras to spot the person holding a gun.""There are machines that have learned how to detect someone with a pistol or a gun or a long rifle or if it's holstered,"" Shankar said.That instantly triggers a warning to people inside the building.""The cameras are going to pick it up, and right after that, the doors are going to lock,"" Shankar said.Then, a drone is launched to follow the gunman as he moves through the campus. It gives location information in real-time that can be passed on to police.""We're only as good as our partnership with the community we serve and, realistically, our industry is really moving towards technology,"" Rocklin Police Chief Rustin Banks said.""This technology certainly, I think, would put a lot of parents at ease,"" said Greg Roberson with the Rocklin Chamber of Commerce.Shankar has two small kids of his own and said there is a growing need for schools to modernize security measures.""Schools are going to adapt to some type of robotics,"" he said. ""Whether it's a drone, whether it's a camera, it's important to save lives.""The company said this type of technology can also be used in shopping malls and to prevent shootings in the workplace."

""We're trying to do it very Pentagonese from the top down, which means we're going to spend tens of billions of dollars for a couple of high-profile failures versus spending, you know, one million dollars on nine failures and one success."" The U.S. discovered Ukraine’s unbelievable advancement with AI just months into the war. Brett Velicovich, a Fox News contributor embedded in Ukraine in 2023, claimed the advancements Ukrainian technicians had achieved and how they had achieved them were ""out of this world,"" and the U.S. had no idea about any of it.&nbsp; AI WILL IMPACT 60% OF US JOBS, INCREASE INEQUALITY WORLDWIDE, IMF WARNS Velicovich and other experts described the various ways Ukraine had utilized AI, including facial recognition to locate war criminals, systems to help drone guidance and target selection, satellite analysis to gather evidence of war crimes and identification of Russian disinformation and propaganda.&nbsp; Jensen, who is also a professor of strategic studies at the Marine Corps University School of Advanced Warfighting, discussed the culmination of those efforts in Ukraine’s Delta situational awareness system, which integrates a range of systems, including visual recognition and geolocation mapping, fed data by open source participation from the Ukrainian people.&nbsp; Ukraine unveiled the system in late 2022, but it received little press despite proving enormously helpful in processing the huge amount of battlefield data to guide the Ukrainian forces on the battlefield with active targeting and coordination.&nbsp; WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? Praise for Ukraine’s ingenious efforts notwithstanding, Jensen highlighted the role the United States foreign aid programs have played in helping make these advancements a reality. AI requires data to train the model and platforms, and the United States Agency for International Development programs helped fund the Ukrainian digital identity system.&nbsp; The data sharing and tech partnerships between the U.S. and Ukraine allowed Kyiv to quickly simplify and enhance the system, speeding up everything from aid and assistance delivery to civilian notifications of incoming attacks and helping to find missing persons.&nbsp; James Hess, professor at the School of Security and Global Studies at the American Public University System, agreed that U.S. data not only helped Ukraine achieve these incredible developments, but it also continues to do so.&nbsp; ""To understand the battlefield environment is time-consuming and its complex, and that's, of course,"
20231003,foxnews,NSA announces new artificial intelligence security center: 'Desperately needed',"The National Security Agency (NSA) will launch a new artificial intelligence security center to both protect U.S. AI systems and defend against external threats. The new security center launches as the U.S. government has increased its use of algorithms and AI systems in defense and intelligence and is seeking to safeguard systems from theft or sabotage. The NSA center will also be responsible for protecting the homeland from external AI-related threats, according to a report from Yahoo News on Monday, Army Gen. Paul Nakasone, NSA director, told The Associated Press that the new center could be incorporated into the NSA's existing Cybersecurity Collaboration Center, which works with the private sector and internal partners to strengthen U.S. defenses from near-peer rivals such as China and Russia. Christopher Alexander, the chief analytics officer of Pioneer Development Group, told Fox News Digital such a center is ""desperately needed for intelligence analysis and is crucial for national security."" CIA OFFICIAL SAYS CHINA ‘GROWING EVERY WHICH WAY’ ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ""The most obscure details can complete an intelligence estimate and that requires intelligence analysts who can comb through every piece of information, recognize a [pattern] and turn that data into information — and ultimately a finished analysis,"" Alexander said. ""AI and machine learning can take on the role of literally 1000s of lower-level analysts. It works 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and the sheer amount of data collected allows for whole new methods of analysis."" Alexander pointed to allied intelligence collection efforts during World War II: ""Part of the reason the intel community realized the Germans would attack at the Battle of the Bulge was because of the size of buttons coming from German factories. AI will find and alert human analysts to small details that may otherwise be missed."" Alexander added, ""In the future, predictive analytics will also be improved by collecting and sifting through massive data sets as well. That could completely revolutionize the spycraft trade."" The report comes after a top CIA official warned that China's use of AI programs could be a threat to national security. ""They are growing every which way,"" Lakshmi Raman, the CIA’s director for artificial intelligence, said at the Politico AI &amp; Tech Summit, according to a report on FOX Business.

20230501,foxnews,Students use AI technology to find new brain tumor therapy targets — with a goal of fighting disease faster,"Glioblastoma is one of the deadliest types of brain cancer, with the average patient living only eight months after diagnosis, according to the National Brain Tumor Society, a nonprofit.&nbsp; Two ambitious high school students — Andrea Olsen, 18, from Oslo, Norway, and Zachary Harpaz, 16, from Fort Lauderdale, Florida — are looking to change that.&nbsp; The teens partnered with Insilico Medicine, a Hong Kong-based medical technology company, to identify three new target genes linked to glioblastoma and aging.&nbsp; They used Insilico’s artificial intelligence platform, PandaOmics, to make the discovery — and now, they plan to continue researching ways to fight the disease with new drugs.&nbsp; CHATGPT AND HEALTH CARE: COULD THE AI CHATBOT CHANGE THE PATIENT EXPERIENCE? Their findings about target genes were published on April 26 in Aging, a peer-reviewed biomedical academic journal.&nbsp; A third high school student, Christopher Ren from Shanghai, China, also contributed to the research. Olsen, who attends Sevenoaks School in the U.K., has been studying neuroscience since 2020. She began an internship in 2021 with Insilico, where she learned to use AI to uncover new genetic targets to treat aging and cancer. ""It was there that I started this big investigation into glioblastoma and using AI to research it,"" she told Fox News Digital in an interview. Meanwhile, at Pine Crest High School in Fort Lauderdale, Harpaz — who had been focusing on computer science and biology — was looking to get into medical research.&nbsp; ""There's definitely a way to use artificial intelligence to speed up the study.""

Rep. Mark Green, R-Tenn., told Fox News Digital that China has managed to use technology to erase national awareness of the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989, when hundreds and possibly thousands were killed and many more injured. ""Despite the historical importance of Tiananmen Square, most people in China do not even know the massacre occurred,"" Green said. ""This is because the CCP scrubbed these events from its heavily censored internet and has kept it out of books and out of school. Using its advanced technology, the CCP has erased its own history."" CHINA FUMES AS BIDEN PLOTS TO STARVE IT OF AI INVESTMENT: ‘SCI-TECH BULLYING’ ""This regime steals American intellectual property and then undermines our national security, oppresses its own people, and threatens global stability,"" he added. ""My legislation will keep the CCP from getting access to our sensitive technology."" Green’s bill is the China Technology Transfer Control Act, which is aimed at imposing new limits on U.S. technology exports to China in order to ensure the U.S. maintains its competitive edge, and to keep Beijing from using advanced systems against its own population. ""We must ensure we aren’t giving the CCP the tools to harm our nation or its own people,"" he said when he introduced the bill in mid-April. His bill seeks to impose new export restrictions on technology used to create AI systems and other technology related to robotics, biotech, computing and internet-related services. Export restraints on those goods would be imposed when it would aid China’s military, harm U.S. national security, or allow China to carry out ""violations of human rights or religious liberties"" against its own people. AI PAUSE CEDES POWER TO CHINA, HARMS DEVELOPMENT OF ‘DEMOCRATIC' AI, EXPERTS WARN SENATE Green said AI poses a particular threat, which is why the U.S. must be more cautious and impose export restrictions on China. ""AI offers Americans new and exciting ways to educate our children, run our businesses, and secure our nation, but like many other technologies there is also the risk of foreign malicious activity, including by the CCP,"" he said. Green added that implementing AI systems inside the U.S. can also pose a threat if the full ramifications of these systems aren’t understood. ""The threats posed by the CCP are multi-faceted and complex, to include threats to our nation’s cyber infrastructure and supply chains. Therefore, we must proceed with extreme caution when implementing advanced technological solutions like AI into our nation’s critical infrastructure,"" he said.

20230501,foxnews,Flashback: Stephen Hawking warned AI could mean the 'end of the human race' in years leading up to his death,"Long before Elon Musk and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak signed a letter warning that artificial intelligence poses ""profound risks"" to humanity, British theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking had been sounding the alarm on the rapidly evolving technology. ""The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race,"" Hawking told the BBC in an interview in 2014. Hawking, who suffered from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) for more than 55 years, died in 2018 at the age of 76. Though he had critical remarks on AI, he also used a very basic form of the technology in order to communicate due to his disease, which weakens muscles and required Hawking to use a wheelchair. Hawking was left unable to speak in 1985 and relied on various ways to communicate, including a speech-generating device run by Intel, which allowed him to use facial movements to select words or letters that were synthesized to speech. STEPHEN HAWKING SAID 'THERE IS NO GOD' AND THAT HUMANS WILL 'LIVE IN SPACE' IN FINAL BOOK Hawking’s comment to the BBC in 2014 that AI could ""spell the end of the human race"" was in response to a question about potentially revamping the voice technology he relied on. He told the BBC that very basic forms of AI had already proven powerful but creating systems that rival human intelligence or surpass it could be disastrous for the human race. ""It would take off on its own and re-design itself at an ever-increasing rate,"" he said. BIAS, DEATHS, AUTONOMOUS CARS: EXPERT SAYS AI 'INCIDENTS' WILL DOUBLE AS SILICON VALLEY LAUNCHES TECH RACE ""Humans, who are limited by slow biological evolution, couldn't compete and would be superseded,"" Hawking added. Months after his death, Hawking’s final book hit the market. Titled ""Brief Answers to the Big Questions,"" his book provided readers with answers to questions he was frequently asked. The science book hashed out Hawking’s argument against the existence of God, how humans will likely live in space one day and his fears over genetic engineering and global warming. Artificial intelligence also took a top spot on his list of ""big questions,"" arguing that computers are ""likely to overtake humans in intelligence"" within 100 years. ""We may face an intelligence explosion that ultimately results in machines whose intelligence exceeds ours by more than ours exceeds that of snails,"" he wrote. He argued that computers need to be trained to align with human goals, adding that not taking the risks associated with AI seriously could potentially be ""our worst mistake ever."" TECH EXPERT WARNS AI COULD THREATEN HUMAN CONNECTIVITY, ROMANCE: 'LATEST VERSION OF A LONG TRADITION' ""It's tempting to dismiss the notion of highly intelligent machines as mere science fiction, but this would be a mistake — and potentially our worst mistake ever.""

The Party, led by Big Brother, uses omnipresent technology to monitor constantly and to propagandize to the docile citizens of Oceania. The terrifying tandem of technology and the human intoxicant of power is used in Oceania to rewrite history, control society, crush the human spirit and keep the Party entrenched forever. POLICE USING AI COULD LEAD TO ‘PREDICTIVE’ CRIME PREVENTION ‘SLIPPERY SLOPE,’ EXPERTS ARGUE Protagonist Winston Smith works for the ironically named Ministry of Truth, a job he hates. He dreams of the freedom to think, act, write and love.&nbsp; The totalitarian scenarios described in ""1984,"" and the technologies to enforce them, seemed like science fiction 75 years ago.&nbsp; Yet they appear more possible today with the emergence of artificial intelligence and the stark warnings about its dangers from Elon Musk and others among the brightest people in technology.&nbsp; Digital devices already constantly track our movements and behaviors. Artificial intelligence, experts say, is on the verge of perhaps even predicting our thoughts and actions. ""Big Brother is watching you."" — George Orwell, ""1984"" The warnings of ""1984"" are also more ominous after big tech proved its eagerness to partner with big government in recent years to influence elections and stifle dissent.&nbsp; The book that issued warnings about these very scenarios may now also be a target of governments armed with technology to track dissent.&nbsp; Orwell was recently added to a list compiled by government officials in the U.K. of authors whose works are allegedly shared by people sympathetic to ""the far-right and Brexit,"" according to The Spectator.&nbsp; Here are 10 warnings from ""1984"" that seem more prescient — and more urgent — than ever. 1. The screen on your wall knows what you’re doing ""The instrument (the telescreen, it was called) could be dimmed, but there was no way of shutting it off completely,"" Orwell wrote of the household electronic device in Oceania we now recognize as the television.&nbsp; Few homes in the U.S. or U.K. owned televisions in the late 1940s — but Orwell already saw their potential for surveillance.

One expert said the breakthrough could ""rewrite the history"" of the ancient world. The Herculaneum papyri consist of about 800 rolled-up Greek scrolls that were carbonized during the 79 CE volcanic eruption that buried the ancient Roman town of Pompeii, according to the organizers of the ""Vesuvius Challenge.""Resembling logs of hardened ash, the scrolls, which are kept at Institut de France in Paris and the National Library of Naples, have been extensively damaged and even crumbled when attempts have been made to roll them open.As an alternative, the Vesuvius Challenge carried out high-resolution CT scans of four scrolls and offered $1 million spread out among multiple prizes to spur research on them.The trio who won the grand prize of $700,000 was composed of Youssef Nader, a PhD student in Berlin, Luke Farritor, a student and SpaceX intern from Nebraska, and Julian Schilliger, a Swiss robotics student.The group used AI to help distinguish ink from papyrus and work out the faint and almost unreadable Greek lettering through pattern recognition.""Some of these texts could completely rewrite the history of key periods of the ancient world,"" Robert Fowler, a classicist and the chair of the Herculaneum Society, told Bloomberg Businessweek magazine.The challenge required researchers to decipher four passages of at least 140 characters, with at least 85 percent of characters recoverable.Last year Farritor decoded the first word from one of the scrolls, which turned out to be the Greek word for ""purple."" That earned first place in the First Letters Prize. A few weeks later, Nader deciphered a few columns of text, winning second place.As for Schilliger, he won three prizes for his work on a tool called Volume Cartographer, which ""enabled the 3D-mapping of the papyrus areas you see before you,"" organizers said.Jointly, their efforts have now decrypted about five percent of the scroll, according to the organizers.The scroll's author ""throws shade""The scroll's author was ""probably Epicurean philosopher Philodemus,"" writing ""about music, food, and how to enjoy life's pleasures,"" wrote contest organizer Nat Friedman on social media.The scrolls were found in a villa thought to be previously owned by Julius Caesar's patrician father-in-law, whose mostly unexcavated property held a library that could contain thousands more manuscripts.The contest was the brainchild of Brent Seales, a computer scientist at the University of Kentucky, and Friedman, the founder of Github, a software and coding platform that was bought by Microsoft. As ""60 Minutes"" correspondent Bill Whitaker previously reported, Seales made his name digitally restoring damaged medieval manuscripts with software he'd designed.The recovery of never-seen ancient texts would be a huge breakthrough: according to data from the University of California, Irvine, only an estimated 3 to 5 percent of ancient Greek texts have survived.""This is the start of a revolution in Herculaneum papyrology and in Greek philosophy in general.

20240426,nbcnews,U.S. and China to hold first AI talks amid ongoing TikTok stalemate,"The U.S. and China will hold their first high-level talks on artificial intelligence within the “coming weeks,” U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said Friday, providing no update over the future of Chinese social media giant TikTok. During wide-ranging talks with Chinese officials in Beijing, Blinken said the two sides had agreed to the first U.S.-China intergovernmental dialogue on AI to discuss the risks and safety concerns surrounding the emerging technology. “Earlier today we agreed to hold the first US PRC talks on artificial intelligence to be held in the coming weeks, to share our respective views on risks and safety concerns around advanced AI and how best to manage them,” Blinken said during a press conference. The U.S. imposed restrictions on Beijing’s ability to access high-end tech and is moving close to banning social media app TikTok, unless its Chinese parent ByteDance sells it. Speaking at a press conference, Blinken said that TikTok “did not come up” in the talks. China’s foreign ministry confirmed the AI talks will take place in a statement, which detailed a wider five-point agreement between Washington and Beijing. Also included in the consensus were further efforts to “stabilize and develop” U.S.-China relations, expand cultural exchanges and continue consultations on “international and regional hotspot issues,” the foreign ministry said, according to a Google translation. Blinken said that China had a constructive role to play in helping to resolve global crises, including discouraging Iran and its proxies from further escalating the Middle East conflict, as well as curtailing Russia’s assault on Ukraine. “China has demonstrated in the past when it comes to Russia and Ukraine that it can take positive actions,” he said, referencing a message delivered by Xi in March 2023, warning Russia against the use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine. Blinken nevertheless added that he had reiterated Washington’s “serious concerns” over China’s suspected role in sustaining Moscow’s military capabilities, particularly via products that support its defense industrial base. Beijing has denied that it is assisting Russia militarily, noting that its trade with Moscow constitutes “normal economic cooperation.” Blinken said that no further action had been taken against Beijing, amid reports that Washington is drafting sanctions to cut off some Chinese banks found to be enabling such trade. “Russia would struggle to sustain its assault on Ukraine without China’s help,” he said. “I was extremely clear about our concerns.

20240323,foxnews,"Iran looks to AI to weather Western sanctions, help military to fight 'on the cheap'","Iran has made it no secret that it plans to invest heavily in artificial intelligence (AI) to help better its military capabilities, but Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi is now turning to Iran’s private sector in a move he thinks will boost his crippling economy. On Sunday, Raisi met with private sector companies to announce Tehran’s intent to invest in digital businesses. Raisi claimed the move would not only help develop Iran’s AI capabilities, but help achieve his goal to grow the economy by 8%, reported pro-government media outlet Tasnim News Agency.&nbsp; However, experts remain skeptical about whether the move will actually fix Iran’s economic woes and said they are more concerned by the abilities AI would grant Tehran when it comes to the battlefield.&nbsp; IRANIAN THREATS TO US HAVE 'METASTASIZED' AS PROXIES EMPLOY TACTICS TARGETING HOMELAND: HOUSE HEARING Iran made headlines during the early months of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine when the White House accused it of ""gifting"" Moscow drones, and these deadly aerial weapons have continued to plague other areas like Yemen, Iraq and Syria where Iran-backed militia reside. ""Iran doesn't have endless access to certain technologies, even things like drone engines, because of sanctions. It's not always easy for them to build everything locally,"" Seth Frantzman, author of ""Drone Wars: Pioneers, Killing Machine, Artificial Intelligence and the Battle for the Future"" and adjunct fellow at The Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), told Fox News Digital from Jerusalem.&nbsp; ""But when it comes to AI, they do have access to computers. That's the kind of technology they can invest in because it's something that doesn't require you, necessarily, to import really complicated rocket engines. You can do it locally if you have a high-tech ecosystem,"" Frantzman added, noting Iran’s ability to leverage its access AI technologies.&nbsp; WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? Iran’s move to bolster its military capabilities without relying on physical product imports not only increases Tehran’s security standing in the international sector, but would further enable it to affordably back foreign actors, armed militia and designated terrorist organizations that are active security threats to the U.S. and its Western allies.&nbsp; ""They're looking to expand public/private partnerships to create platforms that would be more directly applicable or usable for the regime,"" Iran expert and senior fellow with the FDD, Behnam Ben Taleblu, told Fox News Digital. US MILITARY SHOOTS DOWN HOUTHI DRONE OVER THE RED SEA Taleblu said that while Tehran will also likely expand how it uses AI as a tool for digital repression, his chief concern is ""how Iran will continue fighting on the cheap using AI.""&nbsp; The Iran expert explained that Iran’s intent to integrate AI militarily with cruise missiles and drones, coupled with hacking campaigns and deepfakes to spread misinformation, gives some insight into the ""mosaic of capabilities"" that Tehran will attempt to employ against the international community.&nbsp; ""Just as you see Iran as an asymmetric powerhouse in the Middle East today, if they layer on that AI component, they will likely continue"

20230915,foxnews,"Artificial intelligence helps doctors predict patients’ risk of dying, study finds: ‘Sense of urgency’","With research showing that only 22% of Americans keep a written record of their end-of-life wishes, a team at OSF HealthCare in Illinois is using artificial intelligence to help physicians determine which patients have a higher chance of dying during their hospital stay. The team developed an AI model that is designed to predict a patient’s risk of death within five to 90 days after admission to the hospital, according to a press release from OSF.&nbsp; The goal is for the clinicians to be able to have important end-of-life discussions with these patients. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE? ""It’s a goal of our organization that every single patient we serve would have advanced care planning discussions documented, so we could deliver the care that they wish — especially at a sensitive time like the end of their life, when they may not be able to communicate with us because of their clinical situation,"" said lead study author Dr. Jonathan Handler, OSF HealthCare senior fellow of innovation, in an interview with Fox News Digital. If patients get to the point where they are unconscious or on a ventilator, for example, it may be too late for them to convey their preferences. Ideally, the mortality predictor would prevent the situation in which patients might die without getting the full benefit of the hospice care they might have gotten if their plans were documented sooner, Handler said. Given that the length of a typical hospital stay is four days, the researchers chose to start the model at five days, ending it at 90 days for a ""sense of urgency,"" the researcher noted. NEW AI-GENERATED COVID DRUG ENTERS PHASE I CLINICAL TRIALS: ‘EFFECTIVE AGAINST ALL VARIANTS’ The AI model was tested on a data set of more than 75,000 patients across different races, ethnicities, genders and socioeconomic factors. The research, recently published in the Journal of Medical Systems, showed that among all patients, the mortality rate was one in 12 people. But for those who were flagged by the AI model as more likely to die during their hospital stay, the mortality rate increased to one in four — three times higher than the average. The model was tested both before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, with nearly identical results, the research team said. The patient mortality predictor was trained on 13 different types of patient information, said Handler.&nbsp; ""That included clinical trends, like how patients’ organs are functioning, along with how often they’ve had to visit the health care system, the intensity of those visits, and other information like their age,"" he said.&nbsp; ""Then the artificial intelligence uses that information to make a prediction about the likelihood that the patient will die within the next five to 90 days.""

20230819,cnn,"Schools are teaching ChatGPT, so students aren’t left behind","When college administrator Lance Eaton created a working spreadsheet about the generative AI policies adopted by universities last spring, it was mostly filled with entries about how to ban tools like ChatGPT. But now the list, which is updated by educators at both small and large US and international universities, is considerably different: Schools are encouraging and even teaching students how to best use these tools. “Earlier on, we saw a knee-jerk reaction to AI by banning it going into spring semester, but now the talk is about why it makes sense for students to use it,” Eaton, an administrator at Rhode Island-based College Unbound, told CNN. He said his growing list continues to be discussed and shared in popular AI-focused Facebook groups, such as Higher Ed Discussions of Writing and AI, and the Google group AI in Education. “It’s really helped educators see how others are adapting to and framing AI in the classroom,” Eaton said. “AI is still going to feel uncomfortable, but now they can now go in and see how a university or a range of different courses, from coding to sociology, are approaching it.” With more experts expecting the continued application of artificial intelligence, professors now fear ignoring or discouraging the use of it will be a disservice to students and leave many behind when entering the workforce. Since it was made available in late November, ChatGPT has been used to generate original essays, stories and song lyrics in response to user prompts. It has drafted research paper abstracts that fooled some scientists and passed exams at esteemed universities. The technology, and similar tools such as Google’s Bard, is trained on vast amounts of online data in order to generate responses to user prompts. While they gained traction among users, the tools also raised some concerns about inaccuracies, cheating, the spreading of misinformation and the potential to perpetuate biases. Students are already using AI According to a study conducted by higher education research group Intelligent.com, about 30% of college students used ChatGPT for schoolwork this past academic year and it was used most in English classes. Jules White, an associate professor of computer science at Vanderbilt University, believes professors should be explicit in the first few days of school about the course’s stance on using AI and that it should be included it in the syllabus. “It cannot be ignored,” he said. “I think it’s incredibly important for students, faculty and alumni to become experts in AI because it will be so transformative across every industry in demand so we provide the right training.” Vanderbilt is among the early leaders taking a strong stance in support of generative AI by offering university-wide training and workshops to faculty and students. A three-week 18-hour online course taught by White this summer was taken by over 90,000 students, and his paper on “prompt engineering” best practices is routinely cited among academics. “The biggest challenge is with how you frame the instructions, or ‘prompts,’” he said. “It has"
20240430,cnn,Samsung reports enormous jump in profit on AI boom,"Samsung Electronics forecast demand for artificial intelligence would hold strong and tighten supply of some high-end chips, joining rivals in benefiting from a solid rebound in the battered global memory chip market. The upbeat outlook from the world’s largest memory chip maker sent its shares 1.8% higher on Tuesday after it reported a more than 10-fold rise in first-quarter operating profit. But so far this year Samsung shares are down 0.8%, lagging SK Hynix’s 24% gain, as it seeks to catch up with its smaller rival in the supply of top-end chips such as high bandwidth memory (HBM) to AI leader Nvidia (NVDA). “We plan to increase supply of HBM-related chips in 2024 by more than three-fold versus last year,” Jaejune Kim, a Samsung vice president in charge of the memory division, said on an earnings call. Samsung said it began mass production this month of the latest HBM chips for use in generative AI chipsets, called 8-layer HBM3E. It is seeking to capitalize on the AI boom that has benefited SK Hynix, which had been the sole supplier of HBM3 chips to Nvidia. Samsung said it planned to start making the 12-layer version during the second quarter, and expected the latest HBM3E products to account for two-thirds of its HBM output by year-end. Analysts said the targets were aggressive. Samsung’s 8-layer HBM3E appears to be supplying Nvidia, while the 12-layer may go to AMD (AMD) and Nvidia, said Jeff Kim, head of research at KB Securities. “As Samsung’s technology is advantageous for high-stacking, while SK Hynix has its advantages in the 8-layer, there may be a segmentation where Nvidia gets 12-layer products from Samsung and most 8-layer products from SK Hynix,” Kim said. “Samsung is working hard to improve the yield of its 12-layer product,” he added. Samsung did not respond immediately to a request for comment on its HBM customers. Samsung also said it will step up offerings of high-end solid-state drive (SSD) products to meet AI server demand, and expected high-end memory chip supply to become tighter toward year-end due to capacity being focused on HBM, echoing comments from SK Hynix last week. Jump in operating profit The South Korean company’s first-quarter revenue rose 13% to 71.9 trillion won ($52.14 billion), including a 96% increase in memory chip revenue to 17.49 trillion won as prices rose steeply from a severe downturn, partly thanks to the boom in AI. Operating profit rose to 6.6 trillion won in January to March, up from 640 billion won a year earlier. It was the company’s highest operating profit since the third quarter of 2022. The chip division, historically Samsung’s cash cow business that used to account for two-thirds of its operating profit, swung to a profit of 1.91 trillion won in the March quarter from a 4.58 trillion won loss a year earlier. It was the first profit since the third quarter of 2022. Prices of NAND flash chips used to store data increased by 23% to 28% during the"

You've seen ""The View,"" but now science is bearing it out. It's amazing. It begins with a new artificial intelligence study out of Denmark, which is a country I believe, turns out AI can now predict a person's political leanings with 61% accuracy, and it's based solely on their face. It's far more accurate than the old method, which was based on *** size. But when they judge the facial features used to make these political predictions, they found something else, the right-wingers were way hotter. Yeah, yeah, yeah, but with some notable exceptions, of course, he brought down the curve. But now here's the boring part, Danish scientist, those are the kind with cheese or fruit filling. They fed 3,200 photos of political candidates into the AI tool to assess their emotional state. And after the analysis, they found that 80% displayed a happy expression, but behind those happy faces were conservative female politicians who looked happier and more attractive than liberals. Now reasons for this happiness abound, you're not surrounded by gloom and doom, and it's easier to walk in heels without cloven hooves, and I'm sure that bathing helps. But the study's authors note that such a finding makes sense because previous research has also highlighted this link between attractiveness and conservatism, which means it's a it's time for a gratuitous shot of Dana Perino. Isn't she lovely? Yeah, and that's without makeup. Here she is with makeup, yeah.&nbsp; So why are conservatives so hot? What could be the reason for this? Are liberal women really uglier than conservative women? And is that why they still wear useless masks when driving alone in their tiny cars? Or could it be due to adopting an ideology of hopelessness based on the unfixable nature of an evil society and that begets their anger, which ultimately undermines their natural good looks?

""The urgency is very clear in the U.N.’s perspective,"" Under-Secretary-General and U.N. Tech Envoy Amandeep Gill told Fox News Digital in an interview. ""Urgency in terms of addressing the risks and addressing the governance gap in the institutions."" Gill has led the way on the U.N.’s efforts to establish an advisory committee on AI policy, which the organization expects to have up and running by the end of the year. The committee is something the U.N. can establish since it has no governing power, and any watchdog agency must come from the member states and the U.N. can only act with what power the members provide it. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres recently urged members to pay attention to ""alarm bells over the latest form of artificial intelligence,"" which are ""loudest from the developers who designed it."" AI FOUNDER SAYS TECHNOLOGY'S ROLE IN EDUCATION WILL BE ‘INEVITABLE’ ""We must take those warnings seriously,"" he said, calling for the formation of an agency ""inspired by what the international agency of atomic energy is today.""&nbsp; The U.N. has repeatedly stressed the urgency of having guardrails in place to handle the ""tremendous potential"" of AI technology, but the lack of investment in governance tools, ""benchmarks"" and safety requirements has left governments and member states under-equipped for the changes that AI will create within society.&nbsp; ""Public sector institutions are way behind in terms of their understanding, in terms of their ability to cope with the implications, whether it's the shifts in the job market or misinformation, disinformation, the threat to democracies,"" Gill said.

20240602,foxnews,DOJ claims it can't release Biden-Hur interview due to threat of AI deepfakes,"The Justice Department cannot release audio from President Biden's interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur due to the threat of potential deepfakes, the DOJ argued in a Friday court filing. The filing came as part of a legal challenge against Biden's efforts to exercise executive privilege over the recording to keep it from the public. The DOJ acknowledged in its Friday filing that there is already enough public audio available to create AI deepfakes of both Biden and Hur, but it said releasing the true recording would make it more difficult to disprove any false versions. ""The passage of time and advancements in audio, artificial intelligence, and ‘deep fake’ technologies only amplify concerns about malicious manipulation of audio files. If the audio recording is released here, it is easy to foresee that it could be improperly altered, and that the altered file could be passed off as an authentic recording and widely distributed,"" the department wrote. Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer wrote in the filing that releasing the tape would ""make it far more likely that malicious actors could pass off a deepfake as the authentic recording."" BIDEN ASSERTS EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE OVER RECORDINGS FROM CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS PROBE Biden's administration is facing a myriad of efforts from conservative legal groups and House Republicans to force the release of the audio. The DOJ has already released a transcript of the interview, which revealed multiple embarrassing moments for the president. BIDEN, NOT SPECIAL COUNSEL HUR, BROUGHT UP SON'S DEATH IN QUESTIONING Biden met with Hur for about five hours last year, when he was grilled about his handling of the classified documents. Hur's report, released earlier this year, declared Biden to be a forgetful, but well-meaning elderly man. The report highlighted several instances where Biden could not recall key details about his life, including when he served as vice president and the year of his son Beau Biden's death. Biden was outraged at the report and subsequently got caught in a number of false statements regarding his interview. For instance, he claimed that Hur brought up the topic of Beau's death, despite the transcript showing that Biden had broached the topic. HUNTER BIDEN IS IN COURT IN DELAWARE. HERE'S WHAT HE DOESN'T WANT THE JURY TO HEAR ""President Biden is apparently afraid for the citizens of this country and everyone to hear those tapes,"" House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said after Biden exerted privilege over the recording.

20230907,cnn,"Suspected Chinese operatives using AI generated images to spread disinformation among US voters, Microsoft says","Suspected Chinese operatives have used images made by artificial intelligence to mimic American voters online in an attempt to spread disinformation and provoke discussion on divisive political issues as the 2024 US election approaches, Microsoft analysts warned Thursday. In the last nine months, the operatives have posted striking AI-made images depicting the Statute of Liberty and the Black Lives Matter movement on social media, in a campaign that Microsoft said focuses on “denigrating U.S. political figures and symbols.” The alleged Chinese influence network used a series of accounts on “Western” social media platforms to upload the AI-generated images, according to Microsoft. The images were fake and generated by a computer, but real people, whether wittingly or unwittingly, propagated the images by reposting them on social media, Microsoft said. Microsoft said the social media accounts were “affiliated” with the Chinese Communist Party. The growing potential for adversaries to use AI to sow disinformation among US voters is an acute concern for election officials as they prepare for a contentious possible 2024 rematch between President Joe Biden and former president Donald Trump. The concern is that foreign operatives will amplify an already-ripe domestic information environment. 69% of Republicans and Republican-leaners still say Biden’s 2020 win was not legitimate, according to a CNN poll in July. “We can expect China to continue to hone this technology over time and improve its accuracy, though it remains to be seen how and when it will deploy it at scale,” Clint Watts, general manager of Microsoft’s Digital Threat Analysis Center, wrote in a blog. The AI-made images have “drawn higher levels of engagement from authentic social media users” than some previous posts by the network of alleged Chinese accounts, Microsoft said, but the company did not provide specific metrics. “In recent years, some western media and think tanks have accused China of using artificial intelligence to create fake social media accounts to spread so-called ‘pro-China’ information,” Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, DC, said in an email to CNN when asked for comment on the Microsoft report. “Such remarks are full of prejudice and malicious speculation against China, which China firmly opposes.” After the 2016 US presidential election, when Russian operatives used Facebook and Twitter to try to amplify divisions among voters, US officials have warned that China or other foreign powers could adopt that playbook. Ahead of the 2022 US midterm elections, Russian and Chinese government-affiliated operatives and organizations promoted misinformation about the integrity of American elections that originated in the US, senior FBI officials have said. More evidence of Chinese influence operations aimed at sowing discord in the US has emerged in recent months. Pro-Beijing operatives paid a handful of unwitting Americans to protest in the US about racial inequality and a US ban on goods produced in the Chinese region of Xinjiang, researchers from security firm Mandiant said in July. Meanwhile, Facebook parent company Meta last month said it had taken down the largest known “cross-platform covert influence operation”"

There's a learning curve, there's challenges. There's going to be hiccups."" Melugin expressed she does see ""real concerns"" with generative A.I.’s impact on politics, specifically noting misinformation threats amid election season. ""With A.I. in elections, the concerns are more the quantity,"" Melugin said. ""You can generate misinformation a lot faster and a lot more cheaply than you would have been able to before."" The tech expert predicted Snapchat Dreams may be primarily used by younger generations for what she called ""goofy fun,"" as opposed to malign intent. ""It'll be plugging yourself into a renaissance scene or whatever you're into. And I think for the most part, that remains harmless,"" Melugin said. ""It's so hard to define A.I., exactly what it is, and it's so many different things in so many different areas, and there's been so much negative press about it and so much emphasis on the dangers as opposed to the possible benefits. People have this sort of knee-jerk negative reaction to it."" But Melugin did note the possibility of defamation of name, image and likeness legal cases being brought forth once the feature allows generative A.I. editing of people other than yourself. ""Common law is going to have to catch up with this. This is new. There's going to be cases brought and precedent set, and hopefully, common law reactions to that will be based on how the law's worked in the past,"" the tech expert said. ""What could be realistically mistaken? Is someone intending to harm someone or profit off them?"" she added."
20230128,cbsnews,University of Minnesota law professors test if AI program ChatGPT can pass their final exams,"MINNEAPOLIS -- You may have heard recently about the artificial intelligence program Chat GPT. Some University of Minnesota law professors wanted to find out if it could pass their final exams.Professor Dan Schwarcz had his doubts, but as he graded his students' exams he genuinely couldn't tell which one was written by a student and which was written by an AI program.RELATED: What exactly is ChatGPT?""The questions we ask on law school exams are not 'tell me when this law was passed', or the types of things you can ask Google to give you an answer,"" Schwarcz said.In the end, the test taken by ChatGPT passed with a C+""It's a passing grade at a really good law school,"" said Schwarcz. ""Our students are really excellent. To get a passing grade, it's very difficult questions.""Students at the U are chatting about it too.""It's all over Twitter, it's all over social media,"" said student Brian Gatter. ""The part that almost surprised me is that it only got a C+.""Schwarcz says now it's on teachers to make sure it's not used to cheat, but rather think of new ways it can be used for good.""AI can't just write a brief, it can't just write a will. But what it can do is be a useful tool,"" he said.Schwarcz says in the long run, AI likely won't end up replacing attorneys, but helping them. The Research is presented in a 16-page report called ""ChatGPT goes to Law school."" According to the report, despite the C+ grade, the AI exceeded in some areas of the test while struggling in others. Ninety-nine percent of students who pass that test pass the bar. "

20240209,cbsnews,"New Jersey teen sues classmate for allegedly creating, sharing fake AI nudes","A New Jersey teen is suing a classmate for allegedly creating and sharing AI-generated pornographic images of herself and other classmates. A male classmate used an ""AI application or website"" to alter photos of the 15-year-old, who is identified only as Jane Doe because she is a minor, and other female classmates at Westfield High School, according to a federal lawsuit, filed in the United States District Court District of New Jersey. The photos were initially shared on Instagram.In all of the photos, Jane Doe and the other girls were clothed, but the AI application digitally removed the clothing and created new images that made the girls appear nude. Their faces remained easily identifiable, the lawsuit said. ""These nude photos of Jane Doe and other minor girls are virtually indistinguishable from real, unaltered photos,"" the lawsuit said. The classmate who allegedly made the images then shared the edited photos with fellow classmates and ""possibly others,"" the lawsuit said, using the Internet and Snapchat to distribute them during the summer of 2023. Snapchat's parent company, Snap, told CBS News that their policies prohibit the sharing of such images, and that their app cannot be used to create them. ""We have zero tolerance for the sexual exploitation of any member of our community,"" Snap said in a statement. Jane Doe and her family learned about the images in October 2023, when her parents, who were also not identified in the lawsuit, were contacted by her Union County high school. The school's assistant principal said that officials were aware of the images and had confirmed that Jane Doe was a ""victim,"" the suit said. According to the assistant principal, a student had called into the school office to alert officials about seeing nude photos of Jane Doe. The defendant's father also reached out to Jane Doe's parents, according to the lawsuit. Jane Doe's parents ""immediately cooperated with an investigation launched by the Westfield Police Department,"" but charges were not pursued because the information gathered by school officials could not be used in the investigation. In addition the ""defendant and other potential witnesses failed to cooperate with, speak to, or provide access to their electronic devices to law enforcement."" Law enforcement was not able to determine how widely the photos had been shared, or ensure that the photos were deleted and not shared further, the lawsuit said. ""Victims of child and nonconsensual pornography in which their actual faces appear, including Jane Doe, are not only harmed and violated by the creation of such images, but they are also haunted for the rest of their lives by knowing that they were and likely will continue to be exploited for the sexual gratification of others and that, absent court intervention, there is an everlasting threat that such images will be circulated in the future,"" the lawsuit said.Jane Doe ""suffered and will continue to suffer substantial"" reputational and psychological harm because of the photos, the lawsuit said, and she has dealt with ""substantial emotional distress, mental"
20230910,foxnews,Microsoft and Paige partner to create world's largest AI model for cancer detection: 'Unprecedented scale',"Microsoft is partnering with the digital pathology company Paige to build the world's largest image-based artificial intelligence (AI) model to help detect cancer, the companies announced. The AI model will be used for digital pathology and oncology, configured with billions of parameters to provide a computer vision AI that is orders of magnitude larger than any similar model existing today. Dr. Thomas Fuchs, Paige's founder and chief scientist, told FOX News Digital that the amount of data used in the model is ""orders of magnitude"" larger than anything made public by Google or Facebook. ""It's so much larger than anything that has been published in that area ever,"" he said. WEARABLE DEVICE WITH AI COULD ALLOW FOR AT-HOME BREAST CANCER SCREENINGS: ‘ACCESSIBLE AND PERSONALIZED' That scale is essential for patients. While already established models include up to 100,000 slides, Fuchs said a model that can accurately assist pathologists and oncologists needs digitized histology slides in the millions. Paige has helped digitize millions of slides to identify cancers for seven years. Such a task required billions of images and ever-growing AI models, but with such a sizable compute cast, Paige needed more power to work to that scale. ""That's where Microsoft comes in,"" Fuchs said. ""We work with Microsoft on several fronts. So, with Nuance, for example, with Azure and with Microsoft Research and their resources and their compute, we can now build models from thousands of GPUs [graphics processing units] used at an unprecedented scale."" The next development phase will incorporate up to 4 million digitized microscopy slides from a petabyte-scale clinical data archive. With Microsoft's massive established supercomputer infrastructure, Paige will be able to train the model to deploy across laboratories and hospitals using Azure.&nbsp; Fuchs considers the AI model ""ChatGPT for the microscopic world."" WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? ""It's the foundation model for the microscopic world,"" he added. ""The data we use a page to build this foundation model with Microsoft is 10 times more than all of Netflix. All the shows you watch, all the movies, every pixel in all these — there's hundreds of shows, thousands of hours of content, but is just 10% in terms of data of the images we put through these models. So, this will not only be the largest oncology model — it will be the largest-ever publicly announced computer vision model."" The benefits of the model will help better understand the morphology of cancer of normal tissue to a meticulous detail, which can then be used as a foundation for rare cancer models, mutation prediction and response prediction. The model is anticipated to reduce misdiagnosis in medicine significantly. Misdiagnoses in the United States lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and major disabilities each year, according to a recent report from Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. Each year, an estimated 795,000 Americans become permanently disabled or die due to a misdiagnosis, the study found.&nbsp; AI TECH AIMS TO DETECT BREAST CANCER BY MIMICKING RADIOLOGISTS’ EYE MOVEMENTS: 'A CRITICAL"
20221207,nbcnews,Lensa reignites discussion among artists over the ethics of AI art ,"For many online, Lensa AI is a cheap, accessible profile picture generator. But in digital art circles, the popularity of artificial intelligence-generated art has raised major privacy and ethics concerns. Lensa, which launched as a photo editing app in 2018, went viral last month after releasing its “magic avatars” feature. It uses a minimum of 10 user-uploaded images and the neural network Stable Diffusion to generate portraits in a variety of digital art styles. Social media has been flooded with Lensa AI portraits, from photorealistic paintings to more abstract illustrations. The app claimed the No. 1 spot in the iOS App Store’s “Photo & Video” category earlier this month. But the app’s growth — and the rise of AI-generated art in recent months — has reignited discussion over the ethics of creating images with models that have been trained using other people’s original work. Lensa is tinged with controversy — multiple artists have accused Stable Diffusion of using their art without permission. Many in the digital art space have also expressed qualms over AI models producing images en masse for so cheap, especially if those images imitate styles that actual artists have spent years refining. For a $7.99 service fee, users receive 50 unique avatars — which artists said is a fraction of what a single portrait commission normally costs. Companies like Lensa say they’re “bringing art to the masses,” said artist Karla Ortiz. “But really what they’re bringing is forgery, art theft [and] copying to the masses.” In an email to NBC News on Wednesday, Prisma Labs CEO Andrey Usoltsev clarified that bringing art to the masses ""was never part of the company's mission"" and stated that the ""democratization of access"" to technology like Stable Diffusion is ""quite an incredible milestone."" ""What was once available only to techy well-versed users is now out there for absolutely everyone to enjoy. No specific skills are required,"" Usoltsev said. ""As AI technology becomes increasingly more sophisticated and accessible, it is likely that we will see AI-powered tools and features being widely integrated into consumer-facing apps at a rapid scale. We'd like to be a part of this ongoing conversation and steer the use of such technology in a safe and ethical way."" Prisma issued a lengthy Twitter thread on Tuesday morning, in which it addressed concerns of AI art replacing art by actual artists. The thread did not address accusations that many artists didn’t consent to the use of their work for AI training. “As cinema didn’t kill theater and accounting software hasn’t eradicated the profession, AI won’t replace artists but can become a great assisting tool,” the company tweeted. “We also believe that the growing accessibility of AI-powered tools would only make man-made art in its creative excellence more valued and appreciated, since any industrialization brings more value to handcrafted works.” The company said that AI-generated images “can’t be described as exact replicas of any particular artwork.” Usoltsev said that he could not provide further comment regarding the ""third party"
20221207,nbcnews,ChatGPT can generate an essay. But could it generate an “A”?,"After its viral launch last week, the chatbot ChatGPT was lauded online by some as a dramatic step forward for artificial intelligence and the potential future of web search. But with such praise also came concern regarding its potential usage in academic settings. Could the chatbot, which provides coherent, quirky and conversational responses to simple language inquiries, inspire more students to cheat? Students have been able to cheat on assignments using the internet for decades, giving rise to tools meant to check if their work was original. But the fear now is that ChatGPT could render those resources obsolete. Already, some people online have tested out whether it's possible to have the bot complete an assignment. ""holyyyy, solved my computer networks assignment using chatGPT,"" one person, who later clarified the assignment was old, tweeted. Others suggested that its existence could result in the death of the college essay. One technologist went as far as saying that with ChatGPT, ""College as we know it will cease to exist."" Artificial intelligence company OpenAI, which developed ChatGPT, did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding cheating concerns. However, several experts who teach in the field of AI and humanities said the chatbot, while impressive, is not something they’re ready to sound the alarm about when it comes to possible widespread student cheating. ""We’re not there, but we’re also not that far away,"" said Andrew Piper, a professor of language, literatures and culture and a professor of AI and storytelling at McGill University. ""We’re definitely not at the stage of like, out-of-the-box, it’ll write a bunch of student essays and no one will be able to tell the difference."" Piper and other experts who spoke with NBC News likened the fear around cheating and ChatGPT to concerns that arose when the calculator was invented, when people thought it would be the death of humans learning math. Lauren Klein, an associate professor in the Departments of English and Quantitative Theory and Methods at Emory University, even compared the panic to the philosopher Plato’s fears that writing would dissolve human memory. “There’s always been this concern that technologies will do away with what people do best, and the reality is that people have had to learn how to use these technologies to enhance what they do best,” Klein said. Academic institutions will need to get creative and find ways to integrate new technologies like ChatGPT into their curriculum just like they did during the rise of the calculator, Piper noted. In reality, AI tools like ChatGPT could actually be used to enhance education, according to Paul Fyfe, an associate professor of English at North Carolina State University. He said there’s plenty of room for collaboration between AI and educators. “It’s important to be talking about this right now and to bring students into the conversation,"" Fyfe said. ""Rather than try to legislate from the get-go that this is strange and scary, therefore we need to shut it down."" And some teachers are already"

Suicide is now the 11th leading cause of death in the country — and the second among people between 10 and 35 years of age and fifth among those aged 35 to 54, per the report.&nbsp; As the need for mental health care escalates, the U.S. is struggling with a shortage of providers. To help fill this gap, some medical technology companies have turned to artificial intelligence as a means of possibly making providers’ jobs easier and patient care more accessible.&nbsp; CHATGPT FOR HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS: CAN THE AI CHATBOT MAKE THE PROFESSIONALS' JOBS EASIER? Yet there are caveats connected to this. Read on.&nbsp; The state of mental health care Over 160 million people currently live in ""mental health professional shortage areas,"" according to the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), an agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. &nbsp; By 2024, it is expected that the total number of psychiatrists will reach a new low, with a projected shortage of between 14,280 and 31,091 individuals.&nbsp; ""Lack of funding from the government, a shortage of providers, and ongoing stigma regarding mental health treatment are some of the biggest barriers,"" Dr. Meghan Marcum, chief psychologist at AMFM Healthcare in Orange County, California, told Fox News Digital.&nbsp; ""Wait lists for therapy can be long, and some individuals need specialized services like addiction or eating disorder treatment, making it hard to know where to start when it comes to finding the right provider,"" Marcum also said.&nbsp; Elevating mental health care with AI A Boston, Massachusetts medical data company called OM1 recently built an AI-based platform, called PHenOM, for physicians.&nbsp; The tool pulls data from over 9,000 clinicians working in 2,500 locations across all 50 states, according to Dr. Carl Marci, chief psychiatrist and managing director of mental health and neuroscience at OM1. Over 160 million people live in ""mental health professional shortage areas."" Physicians can use that data to track trends in depression, anxiety, suicidal tendencies and other mental health disorders, the doctor said. ""Part of the reason we're having this mental health crisis is that we haven't been able to bring new tools, technologies and treatments to the bedside as quickly as we’d like,"" said Dr. Marci, who has also been running a small clinical practice through Mass General Brigham in Boston for 20 years. Eventually, artificial intelligence could help patients get the care they need faster and more efficiently, he said. Can AI help reduce suicide risk? OM1’s AI model analyzes thousands of patient records and uses ""sophisticated medical language models"" to identify which individuals have expressed suicidal tendencies or actually attempted suicide, Dr. Marci said.&nbsp; ""We can look at all of our data and begin to build models to predict who is at risk for suicidal ideation,"" he said. ""One approach would be to look for particular outcomes — in this"

Following the release of ChatGPT last November, tech companies have been rushing to develop powerful AI systems to keep the pace with competitors. The AI Incident Database, which is run by nonprofit Responsible AI Collaborative, tracks various incidents caused by AI and is projected to record double the number of incidents this year compared to last. The database defines incidents through examples such as an autonomous car killing a pedestrian, a ""trading algorithm"" causing a ""market ‘flash crash’ where billions of dollars transfer between parties,"" or a ""facial recognition system"" causing ""an innocent person to be arrested."" ""There is no such thing as a minor incident with AI,"" said Sean McGregor, the founder of the AI Incident Database who previously worked as a machine learning architect. &nbsp; ""If I produce a system that makes 8 billion people feel slightly more depressed, then that system will have pushed some number of people to suicide,"" McGregor told Fox News Digital. ""The unfortunate matter is that with fantastical scale even small impacts add up."" REGULATORS SHOULD KEEP THEIR HANDS OFF AI AND FORGET MUSK-BACKED PAUSE: ECONOMIST The AI Incident Database tracks the ""history of harms or near harms"" caused by the proliferation of AI technology in order ""to learn from experience so we can prevent or mitigate bad outcomes,"" according to the database’s website. McGregor said the website is a response to philosopher George Santayana’s aphorism, ""Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it."" ""We must remember past incidents so we can engineer a better future,"" McGregor said. The tech expert believes that incidents caused by AI will likely skyrocket this year, according to Newsweek. Overall, the database has found more than 500 examples of AI incidents from 2003 to this year. Last year ended with 90 incidents, and there have already been 45 incidents this year between January and March.&nbsp; CHATGPT AI LISTS JOBS IT CAN DO BETTER THAN HUMANS AS MILLIONS COULD BE PUT OUT OF WORK ""We expect AI incidents to far more than double in 2023 and are preparing for a world where AI incidents are likely to follow some version of Moore's Law,"" McGregor told Newsweek, which projected 2023 will see about 180 incidents, based on the data’s current rate of incidents. Moore’s Law is an observation from an Intel co-founder that transistors on a circuit would double every two years, making the speed and capability of computers also increase. The database – which allows users to search by information such as the year of the incident, the developer behind the AI system or a description of the incident – shows that 20 years ago, there were four reports of AI incidents. The incidents include a claim that a maternity ad from Target allegedly predicted a teenager was pregnant before her"
20230425,cbsnews,Generative AI: Can AI help customer service reps help customers better?,"Love it or hate it, so-called generative artificial intelligence has proved its ability to make at least one type of worker more productive on the job. Using the enhanced AI boosted the productivity of customer service representatives at a Fortune 500 software firm by 14%, according to the first study to examine the emerging technology's use by employees in a real workplace.Notably, human support agents reported resolving more customer queries per hour when aided by a custom-built tool powered by OpenAI's GPT technology. Assistance from the AI also improved customer sentiment, reduced the volume of requests for managerial intervention, and even improved employee retention, presumably because it allowed service agents to have more pleasant interactions with customers, according to Erik Brynjolfsson, one of the paper's authors and a senior fellow at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI (HAI) and director of the Stanford Digital Economy Lab.""There was less churn once they used this tool because it seemed workers were happier and enjoyed the job more,"" he told CBS MoneyWatch. ""We wondered if it would push them harder, but it seems to be something workers liked. Customers were happier and I'm guessing as a call center operator, it's more enjoyable to interact with happy customers.""The AI revolution: Google's artificial intelligence developers on what's next in the fieldService reps interacting with customers through text chats used the custom-built AI tool to help them find answers to client questions. Specifically, the AI read interactions between customers and support agents, and generated suggested responses for the agents to use. They also had the ability to accept or reject the AI-generated text answers. ""It basically saw both what the customers and agents were saying and would give them strategically-timed hints or suggestions,"" Brynjolfsson said.For example, the AI tool would prompt reps to mention products or possible upgrades customers could make to solve their problems. It was also sensitive to tone, offering guidance to agents how to politely""communicate with clients. The AI was trained on thousands of client-agent interactions that were labeled as either successful or unsuccessful. ""It tended to know what worked well with customers,"" Brynjolfsson said.The results: Agents generally solved problems faster, customers were happier, new employees got up to speed faster and the employer (which wasn't identified in the study) experienced less turnover. ""People worry this is going to replace everything. I think by far the bigger effect is it augmenting us, like a calculator. It allows us to do things faster and more efficiently,"" Brynjolfsson said.

""The race with China to build autonomous weapons systems is the defining defense challenge of the next 100 years,"" Christopher Alexander, chief analytics officer at Pioneer Development Group, told Fox News Digital.&nbsp; The comments come as a Reuters report last month detailed the ongoing struggle between the U.S. and its allies and China over the development of AI weapons, a competition that has only become increasingly heated as the world observed the successful use of technologies to resist an invasion of seemingly superior Russian forces for over a year. US MILITARY NEEDS AI VEHICLES, WEAPON SYSTEMS TO BE 'SUPERIOR' GLOBAL FORCE: EXPERTS The report, which relied on research from the Special Competitive Studies Project, noted that China has aggressively pursued advancement in its AI arms, something that could cause a ""shift in the balance of power globally, and a direct threat to the peace and stability that the United States has underwritten for nearly 80 years in the Indo-Pacific."" But like the nuclear arms race before it, the AI arms race comes with constant dangers. The report warns of ""killer robots"" — AI weapons such as subs, warships, fighter jets, drones and combat vehicles that can operate autonomously. While such technology has the potential to be a force multiplayer on the battlefield, its ability to make decisions independent of human input also poses serious risks. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? One such system being developed by the Australian Navy in partnership with the U.S., called Ghost Sharks, is an unmanned AI-powered submarine the size of a school bus that can patrol oceans and survive maneuvers that would be impossible for conventional military vehicles.

Ziven Havens, policy director at the Bull Moose Project, told Fox News Digital. ""Military technology powered by artificial intelligence is going to forever change warfare."" US, NOT CHINA, SHOULD TAKE LEAD ON AI Havens argued that the stakes couldn't be higher, saying that allowing China to be the leader in the development of such technology would lead to a more dangerous world for the U.S. and its allies. ""The current state of the world, paired with a potential military conflict in Taiwan, further proves that the U.S. being anything but the leader of this technology will make America and our allies less safe,"" Havens said.&nbsp; Phil Siegel, founder of the Center for Advanced Preparedness and Threat Response Simulation, told Fox News Digital that it is likely that virtually ""every well-funded military power"" is involved in the race to develop AI weaponry, though he pointed out that international treaties could lead to the weapons being regulated.

20231017,cnn,Baidu says its AI is in the same league as GPT-4,"Chinese tech giant Baidu is officially taking on GPT-4. On Tuesday, the company unveiled ERNIE 4.0, the newest version of its artificial intelligence chatbot that it directly compared to the latest iteration of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The new ERNIE Bot “is not inferior in any aspect to GPT-4,” Baidu’s billionaire CEO, Robin Li, told an audience at its annual flagship event. Speaking onstage, Li showed how the bot could generate a commercial for a car within minutes, solve complicated math problems and create a plot for a martial arts novel from scratch. The bot works mainly in Mandarin Chinese, its primary language. It is also able to handle queries and produce responses in English at a less advanced level. Li said the demonstrations showed how the bot had been “significantly improved” in terms of its understanding of queries, generation of complex responses and memory capabilities. While coming up with ideas for the novel, for instance, the bot was able to remember previous instructions and create sophisticated story lines by adding conflicts and characters, said Li. “We always complained that AI was not intelligent enough,” he quipped. “But today, it understands almost everything you say, and in many cases, it understands what you’re saying better than your friends or your colleagues.” China’s moment Charlie Dai, vice president and research director of technology at Forrester, said Baidu is “the first vendor in China” to claim it could perform as well as GPT-4. “We still need more benchmarking evidence to prove it, but I’m cautiously optimistic that this is China’s GPT-4 moment, giving its long-term investment in AI [and machine learning],” he told CNN. In contrast to a pre-recorded presentation in March that failed to impress investors, Li demonstrated the bot in real time. Investors appeared unmoved, however, with Baidu’s shares down 1.4% in Hong Kong following the presentation. Baidu (BIDU) has been a frontrunner in China in the race to capitalize on the excitement around generative AI, the technology that underpins systems such as ChatGPT or its successor, GPT-4. The Beijing-based company unveiled ERNIE Bot in March, before launching it publicly in August. The newest iteration will launch first to invited users, Li said. The company did not specify when it would be made available publicly. ERNIE Bot has quickly gained traction, racking up more than 45 million users after reaching the top of Chinese app stores at one point, according to the company. ChatGPT, which was released last November, surpassed 100 million users in its first two months, according to a March report by Goldman Sachs analysts. Homegrown competition Baidu faces competition within China, from companies such as Alibaba (BABA) and SenseTime, which have also shown off their own ChatGPT-style tools. Baidu says its service stands out because of its advanced grasp of Chinese queries, as well as its ability to generate different types of responses, such as video and audio. By comparison, GPT-4 is also able to analyze photos, but currently only generates text responses, according to its developer, OpenAI."

It may be years until the costs and timelines of drug discovery decrease measurably, particularly because some estimates are that more than 20% of the cost is from clinical trials which are necessarily manual.&nbsp; And I worry that once the shine wears off of AI, interest from those outside of the lab will dissipate. Investors, governments and journalists will play key roles in funding, regulating and publicizing how AI is changing drug discovery.&nbsp; So, I’m laying out my case for paying attention — and staying optimistic — as the life sciences industry does the hard work to make the promise of AI a reality.&nbsp; 1. The industry is (finally) set up to succeed Long seen as a laggard among industries, life sciences is finally catching up in the race to digitally transform.&nbsp; Pharma companies have access to scalable and cost-effective infrastructure and tooling for managing massive amounts of data, particularly as they adopt a more efficient approach to building databases for electronic data capture (EDC). The traditional approach for this sort of database build takes around 12 to 16 weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps just as crucially, the life sciences ecosystem is finally aligned on the importance of digitization. In February 2020, digital leaders surveyed by McKinsey reported that their biggest hurdle to convincing their companies to transform was a ""lack of leadership support.""&nbsp; But today, after the shock of the global coronavirus pandemic, that hurdle barely rates.&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Barriers remain — and they’re getting bigger Strategic alignment and executive leadership are only the first steps. Pharma still faces significant challenges in making AI useful — namely, a tsunami of data and complex new treatment modalities.&nbsp; Advanced research techniques produce ever-larger amounts of information. Genomics research is expected to generate between twp and 40 exabytes of data within the next decade. (An exabyte is one billion gigabytes, so that’s about 8.3 million iPhones’ (128 GB size) worth of storage.) And the velocity of the growth of that data is only increasing.&nbsp; This detailed data offers tremendous long-term value for"
20230922,foxnews,Israel's new multimillion-dollar AI tank provides total battlefield vision: 'A new era',"Israel unveiled the ""Barak"" tank as its newest artificial intelligence (AI)-powered military advancement, promising a ""new era"" in combat capabilities. ""The Barak tank is very innovative — it takes our maneuvering capabilities to another level, and it is a clear expression of our technological capabilities,"" Israeli Minister of Defense (IMOD) Yoav Gallant said of the tank, whose name translates to ""lightning."" ""I would like to express my appreciation to the engineers of the Tank and APC Administration, the Israeli Ground Forces and all those involved in the professional process,"" he added. The fifth-generation Barak tank introduces a 360-degree awareness capability, giving a total vision of the battlefield. In a video that features animated segments to demonstrate the tank’s potential, an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) operator is able to identify targets both in front and behind his tank, thanks to a specially designed helmet that helps him filter battlefield data. GERMAN MILITARY PLOWS MILLIONS INTO AI ‘ENVIRONMENT’ FOR COMBAT-CHANGING WEAPONS TESTS The tank also seamlessly communicates the information to another nearby tank, which can immediately respond to the data and identify the target instead. Tank crews will have touchscreen devices to help them make use of ""unique"" applications with which operators will have greater familiarity as time goes on.&nbsp; The Barak also possesses ""advanced observation and night capabilities"" that allow tank crews to engage in close-range combat, thanks to the improved and up-to-date intelligence collection and sharing made possible by a new wide and reliable ""sensor infrastructure"" with the ability to more precisely analyze terrain.&nbsp; WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? Israeli military commanders stressed the continued value of tanks in the military, with IMOD Director-General (reserves) Eyal Zamir calling tanks ""the backbone of the Armored Corps and on-ground fighting.""&nbsp; However, he noted that the Barak created a ""new era"" for combat and a ""breakthrough on the modern battlefield."" Brig. Gen. Oren Giber, the head of the Defense Merkava and Armored Vehicles Directorate, said the Barak sets a ""very high standard of technological excellence"" for the IDF, thanks to ""a unique weapon system,"" the ""high-quality"" technology added to it and ""built-in flexibility.""&nbsp; SCIENTISTS ON VERGE OF CRACKING CODE FOR TALKING TO ANIMALS The tank’s cost remains undisclosed, but Defense News noted officials equated it to costing roughly as much as the Merkava 4M, which costs around $3.5 million, despite the technological advancements and additions to the Barak. The Barak took five years to develop, and mass production started last month. The tank’s unveiling occurred some two decades after the Merkava’s introduction, which officials believe the Barak will replace by the end of 2025 in the 401st Brigade.&nbsp; Officials also plan to produce ""dozens"" of tanks each year to further update the force.

Economist predicts schools, teachers could become 'obsolete'","With the surge in growth of artificial intelligence, fears over the new technology have experts weighing in on what impact it will have on U.S. education.&nbsp; One economist warned that the technology will eventually lead to the elimination of teaching.&nbsp; ""One of the jobs that is likely to be eliminated by A.I. is teaching,"" Euro Pacific Asset Management chief economist Peter Schiff told FOX News Digital. ""I think certainly for elementary school education K through 12. I think at the end of the day, schools will be obsolete. The teachers, the administrators, the unions, the whole bureaucracy."" Palm Beach Atlantic University professor of communication and Supper Honors Program director Dr. Tom St. Antoine argued, however, the technology presents educators with a ""really good opportunity."" IVY LEAGUE UNIVERSITY UNVEILS PLAN TO TEACH STUDENTS WITH AI CHATBOTS THIS FALL: ‘EVOLUTION’ OF ‘TRADITION’ ""In colleges and universities, we've been sort of obsessed with A.I. technology because for a lot of people, it poses little challenges like plagiarism and it sort of devalues the ability to do original work. So it's something that gets talked about a lot on universities,"" St. Antoine told FOX News Digital. ""In the midst of all that sort of hand-wringing, I've seen it as a really good opportunity. I welcome those conversations because I think it sort of puts a spotlight on the fact that universities have been promising to give students something that really is outside our strength. It's outside what a true university education can offer."" Similarly to the rise of the internet, artificial intelligence has already made its way into the education system from ChatGPT to even teaching college courses at some of the nation's most prestigious universities.&nbsp; ChatGPT is a generative AI chatbot capable of having conversations with humans, suggesting edits to computer programming code, writing songs, poems, movie scripts and more. In education, ChatGPT has been a controversial tool some teachers perceive as a threat to traditional pedagogy. IN EDUCATION, ‘AI IS INEVITABLE,’ AND STUDENTS WHO DON'T USE IT WILL ‘BE AT A DISADVANTAGE’: AI FOUNDER Many students have been utilizing the technology for schoolwork and assignments, including essay writing. AI has also proven to be a useful tool in helping students with their college applications.&nbsp; Schiff argues the potential transformation of education from human teaching to A.I. is a ""wonderful"" thing, noting economic and social benefits.&nbsp; ""People's property taxes could go down dramatically if we don't need those public schools. But also, it's going to be a great leveling field because, right now, kids who are in affluent communities who are born to wealthier parents, as you know, even if they're in the public schools, they're in a much better public school than some kid born in the inner city.

20230508,cbsnews,Doctors team up with ChatGPT to handle flood of patient messages,"Health systems are turning to artificial intelligence to solve a major challenge for doctors: seeing a steady flow of patients while also responding promptly to people's messages with questions about their care.Physicians at three different health care systems across the U.S. are testing a ""generative"" AI tool based on ChatGPT that automatically drafts responses to patients' queries about their symptoms, medications and other medical issues. The goal is to help cut down on the time doctors spend on written communications and free them up to see more patients in-person, as well focus on more medically complex tasks. UC San Diego Health and UW Health have been piloting the tool since April. Stanford Health Care, considered one of the country's leading hospitals, expects to make its AI tool available to some physicians beginning next week. At least a dozen or so physicians are already using it on a regular basis as part of the trial.""Patient messages in-and-of themselves aren't a burden — it's more of a demand-capacity mismatch,"" Dr. Patricia Garcia, a gastroenterologist at Stanford who is leading the pilot, told CBS MoneyWatch. ""Care teams don't have the capacity to address the volume of patient messages they receive in a timely way.""The tool, a HIPAA-compliant version of OpenAI's GPT language model, is integrated into physicians' inboxes through medical software company Epic's ""MyChart"" patient portal that lets clients send messages to their health care providers.""It could be a great opportunity to support patient care and open up clinicians for more complex interactions,"" Dr. Garcia said. ""Maybe large language models could be the tool that changes the 'InBasket' from burden to opportunity.""The hope is that the tool will lead to less administrative work for doctors, while at the same time improving patient engagement and satisfaction. ""If it works as predicted, it's a win across the board,"" she added. Can AI show empathy?Although corresponding with the new generation of AI is no substitute for interacting with a doctor, research suggests the technology is now sophisticated enough to engage with patients — a vital aspect of care that can be overlooked given America's fragmented and bureaucratic health care system.Indeed, a recent study published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine found that patients preferred responses from ChatGPT over doctors to nearly 200 queries posted in a social media forum online. The chatbot responses were rated higher by patients for both quality and empathy, the authors found. Dr. Christopher Longhurst, an author of the study, said this shows that tools like ChatGPT offer enormous promise for their use in health care. ""I think we're going to see this move the needle more than anything has in the past,"" said Longhurst, chief medical officer and chief digital officer at UC San Diego Health, as well as an associate dean at the UC San Diego School of Medicine. ""Doctors receive a high volume of messages. That is typical of a primary care doctor, and that's the problem we are trying to help solve.""Notably, using technology to help doctors"
20230804,foxnews,"Pentagon turns to Silicon Valley to accelerate AI tech development, adoption: report","Silicon Valley has started scooping up military contracts as the Pentagon turns to private companies to boost artificial intelligence (AI) development and adoption, according to reports. ""This kind of change doesn’t always move as smoothly or as quickly as I’d like,"" Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said during a speech in December to a group that included start-up tech companies.&nbsp; The courtship between tech start-ups and the Department of Defense (DOD) started well before the public engagement with large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT: Saildrone, a start-up founded in 2013, had started developing an armada of AI systems to conduct surveillance on international waters in 2021. Alexander Karp, CEO and co-founder of Palantir Technologies, wrote an open letter to European leaders just weeks after Russia invaded Ukraine February 2022 and urged them to modernize their armies with Silicon Valley’s help. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? ""An embrace of the relationship between technology and the state … will be required for Europe and its allies to remain strong enough to defeat the threat of foreign occupation,"" Karp wrote. The U.S. seemed to take notice and began to more directly engage with tech CEOs and start-up enterprises: The Pentagon turned more openly toward AI when it awarded Silicon Valley-based startup DeepMedia a contract to develop tech that could detect deepfake technology manipulation of media. ""We’ve been contracted to build machine learning algorithms that are able to detect synthetically generated or modified faces or voices across every major language, across races, ages and genders, and develop that AI into a platform that can be integrated into the DOD at large,"" said Rijul Gupta, CEO and co-founder of DeepMedia. EXPERT ISSUES WARNING ON AUTONOMOUS AI SYSTEMS BEING WEAPONIZED The DOD had previously contracted with DeepMedia to create a universal translator platform to ""accelerate and enhance language translation among allies,"" showing intent to utilize AI both on and off the battlefield. A House bill passed last month required the Pentagon to ensure its AI development strengthened both offensive and defensive capabilities. The New York Times reported on a number of companies that by the summer of 2023 had taken up military contracts to develop military technology, such as Capella Space’s fleet of small satellites that can track enemy troops at night – even under cloud cover. The invasion of Ukraine provided a testing ground for this technology that might have otherwise been unavailable, and demand for such technology accelerated in the wake of an increasingly rocky international security landscape. NEW AI ULTRASOUND TECH IS FIRST TO LAND FDA APPROVAL TO ENHANCE PRENATAL CARE Several of those companies have pushed the power of AI as a vital tool to help boost their profile and attraction to the DOD: Almost half of Palantir’s $1.9 billion in revenues last year came from government contracts, including the promise to provide AI software for surveillance technology and data analytics, the Financial Times reported. Investment in defense and weapons tech start-ups has doubled from $16 billion in 2019 to $33 billion"
20230804,nbcnews,Asian American workers could be the most heavily affected by AI,"As the world prepares for a new era of artificial intelligence, a recently released study says that two groups stand to be uniquely affected: Asian Americans and women. They are already among the most exposed to AI in the workplace, and could see parts of their jobs replaced by the new technology, the research found. Released last week by the Pew Research Center, the study determined that out of all U.S. ethnic groups, Asian Americans have the highest share of workers that are regularly exposed to AI. That number is still relatively low: 24 percent of Asian American workers are in fields categorized as “most exposed,” followed by 20 percent of whites, 15 percent of Black people, and 13 percent of Hispanic people. “Most exposed,” according to the report, means the job’s most important activities could be altered or taken over by AI. “It could help or harm. We are uncertain about what the future holds,” said Rakesh Kochhar, a Pew senior researcher and the author of the study. Jobs like budget analysis, data entry and web development were all ranked as being high exposure fields. They tend to be high paying, require college degrees and are heavily intertwined with technology. Chief executives, veterinarians and sales managers were listed as examples of medium exposure jobs, while pipe layers, child care workers and firefighters see low AI exposure. “Asian workers have the greatest degree of formal education,” Kochhar said. “They are more likely to be represented in jobs that are more analytical, that deal with the latest technologies. And that is precisely where artificial intelligence functions.” Hispanic workers, he said, rank on the lower level of AI exposure, as much of the population works in physical labor. “They tend to be concentrated in construction, or in maintenance or landscaping occupations where AI does not yet extend,” he said. “It may in the future.” There is also a significant difference in AI exposure between women and men in the workforce, the study found. Twenty-one percent of women are in jobs that are most exposed to AI, compared to 17 percent of men. Women tend to dominate jobs in health and education, Kochhar said, while men make up more of industries like construction or manufacturing. While AI panic has taken center stage in recent months, the research shows that most workers in highly exposed fields are more hopeful about AI than scared. For example, 32 percent of those in information technology jobs say AI will help more than hurt, while only 11 percent said the opposite. But Asian American community leaders worry that while the technology might benefit those in high-earning, high-tech jobs, lower income Asians might get left behind. “Within the Asian diaspora, the folks that came in during the tech wave have benefited tremendously,” said Khánh Vũ, CEO and executive director of the Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers. “But some of the Asians that came through war, or with different immigration status … they are more blue collar.” While"

The reason? The demand for AI. The company engineers ""the most advanced chips, systems, and software"" for AI. Shares are now worth around $408. Nvidia is the leader in making AI chips, but some experts say that is overvalued, according to Forbes.Last week, the company forecast their second-quarter revenue to be more than 50% above Wall Street estimates, leading analysts to increase their price targets, according to Reuters. The company said it is boosting production of the chips, which are used in products like ChatGPT, the AI bot that can complete tasks and answer questions with impressive accuracy. In an interview with Reuters, Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said the company began producing new AI chips in August and the increasing popularity of AI led to a steep demand increase by January. ""We had to place additional orders, and we procured substantially more supply for the second half"" of 2023, Huang said.With a $1 trillion value, Nvidia joins the ranks of other tech companies like Google, Apple and Microsoft. In fact, it would be the sixth highest valued public company, according to Forbes.Apple comes in at number one, worth an estimated $2.79 trillion. In 2022 it was the first company to reach a $3 trillion value, according to Forbes.On CBS News' ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday, President and Vice Chair of Microsoft Brad Smith said he expects the U.S. government to regulate artificial intelligence in the year ahead. Some tech executives, including Elon Musk, have urged for the regulation of AI, which is used in systems like Google's Bard and even Roombas.

Bob Casey, D-Pa., published the group’s annual fraud book highlighting the top scams last year. It found that from January 2020 to June 2021, the FBI found ""individuals reportedly lost $13 million to grandparent and person-in-need scams."" An estimated $1.1 billion was lost due to cryptocurrency fraud in 2022, according to the FBI. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass, also a member of the committee, said the figure in total losses is ""almost surely an underestimate,"" since it does not factor in the instances of victims who don't report scams due to embarrassment. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? Casey said in a statement that ""federal action"" is needed to put up guardrails to protect consumers from AI-generated scams. There are currently very little regulations on AI capacities, which witnesses urged lawmakers to crack down on through legislation. ""Any consumer, no matter their age, gender, or background, can fall victim to these ultra-convincing scams, and the stories we heard today from individuals across the country are heartbreaking,"" he said. ""As a parent and grandparent, I relate to the fear and concern these victims must feel."" The top 10 categories of scams reported in the fraud book were financial impersonation and fraud, robocalls, computer scams, catfishing on dating profiles, identity theft and others. The most prominent scams used AI technology to mimic people’s voices who then make calls to the victims, family members or loved ones, asking for money. Several testimonies from witnesses in the hearing said they received calls that sounded exactly like their loved one was in danger, was injured or was being held hostage. Tahir Ekin, PhD, director of the Texas State Center for Analytics and Data Science, who was present at the hearing, testified this deliberate strategy of impersonation catapults ""their believability and emotional appeal.""

20240206,nbcnews,Facebook and Instagram will label more AI-made images ahead of November election,"The parent company of Facebook and Instagram said Tuesday it would ramp up its use of labels on artificial intelligence-generated images ahead of the November election but warned it doesn’t yet have the ability to easily detect audio and video made with AI.  Meta said in a blog post that people using its apps want transparency around the quickly improving technology known as generative AI and that the company’s answer for now is to apply a label, “Imagined with AI,” whenever possible.  “It’s important that we help people know when photorealistic content they’re seeing has been created using AI,” Nick Clegg, Meta’s president for global affairs, wrote in the blog post.  Clegg wrote that in the coming months, Meta would start applying the labels to images on Facebook, Instagram and Threads. He said the labels would appear in all languages supported by each app.  The timing coincides with the U.S. elections this year, including November’s presidential race, as well as elections in more than 50 other countries, such as India and Mexico.  “We’re taking this approach through the next year, during which a number of important elections are taking place around the world,” wrote Clegg, a former British deputy prime minister. “During this time, we expect to learn much more about how people are creating and sharing AI content, what sort of transparency people find most valuable, and how these technologies evolve.” Experts have warned that disinformation — including audio, video and images made with AI — poses an unprecedented threat in 2024 and that Americans are ill-prepared for what’s coming.  In one example last month, someone created a robocall from a fake President Joe Biden telling New Hampshire residents not to vote, experts said.  Clegg said Meta is optimistic about quickly detecting AI-generated images, including those made with software from other companies. He said new industrywide technical standards will make it possible for Meta to detect images made with AI software from Google, OpenAI, Microsoft, Adobe, Midjourney and Shutterstock.  The same isn’t true with video and audio, he wrote.  “While companies are starting to include signals in their image generators, they haven’t started including them in AI tools that generate audio and video at the same scale, so we can’t yet detect those signals and label this content from other companies,” he wrote.  In the meantime, he said, Meta would ask people to disclose when they share AI-made video or audio so Meta can add a label.  “We may apply penalties if they fail to do so,” he warned. "

Yeah, AI is now in the same discussion as some of our biggest, most dangerous adversaries. So you think we'd put someone serious in charge of it, right? Someone with gravitas and a piercing intellect, someone who can assure America that everything's under control. So who'd we pick? VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS, OCTOBER 25, 2020: What do you want to know? Yeah, it makes sense. Every time I hear the words artificial intelligence. I think of her. But it's true. Kamala has been tapped as the administration's point person on AI. Apparently, to see if artificial intelligence is no match for her natural stupidity. Oh, and by the way, how is she going to help? By sleeping with R2-D2. ANNOUNCER: A sexist would say! Terrible, but hey, maybe it's a genius move to have our most inane human face off with AI. Five minutes with Kam would make a Roomba pull its own plug. Today, she met with CEOs from major companies developing AI, including Google, Microsoft and Anthropic. Which raises the question, what the hell is Anthropic? A subdivision of Hawaiianthropic? JIMMY FAILLA: That's funny. It is funny. So shut up. According to the White House, the meeting was meant to, ""underscore this responsibility and emphasize the importance of driving responsible, trustworthy and ethical innovation with safeguards that mitigate risks and potential harms to individuals and our society."" Hell, I need an AI to translate that ---- into English. So it's about short and long term dangers of this technology, meaning will they kill us tomorrow or in ten years. And many Dems and Republicans agree it's good that we finally, you know, got around to talking about it, but are we really putting our best foot forward when we send this? FLASHBACK: STEPHEN HAWKING WARNED AI COULD MEAN THE 'END OF THE HUMAN RACE' IN YEARS LEADING UP TO HIS DEATH KAMALA HARRIS, APRIL 25, 2023: I think it's very important... For us at every moment in time, and certainly this one, to seize the moment in time in which we exist and are present. KAMALA HARRIS, MARCH 22, 2023: So during Women's History Month, we celebrate, and we honor the women who made history throughout history. KAMALA HARRIS, MARCH 21, 2022: The significance of the passage of time, right? The significance of the passage of time. So when you think about it, there is great significance to the passage of time.

Another bill permitting prosecutors to bring sexual exploitation charges against producers of child pornography using artificial intelligence (AI) also passed the assembly in the same session.&nbsp; HB 515 would amend Idaho's current statute that carries a life sentence for ""lewd conduct with a minor"" below the age of 16. If the child is under 12, if the act is ""especially heinous, atrocious or cruel, manifesting exceptional depravity,"" then prosecutors would seek the death penalty.&nbsp; Idaho Republican Rep. Bruce Skaug, one of the coauthors of the bills, said that he believed that the U.S. Supreme Court 2008 ruling declaring it unconstitutional to apply the death penalty in cases of child rape where the victim survived was ""the wrong decision."" GALLUP REPORT FINDS DEATH PENALTY INCREASINGLY VIEWED BY AMERICANS AS 'UNFAIRLY' ADMINISTERED The state's new law aligns with Florida's after Gov. Ron DeSantis signed into law last year a measure instituting the death penalty for those convicted of sexually abusing children under 12. The other bill, HB 465, expands on the state's current laws outlawing the creation and distrubution of child pornography by including AI-generated images and videos that are depicted as real children. ""This technology is being used to create thousands of images of children across the world and in Idaho,"" Republican Rep.

20230226,foxnews,Five disturbing examples of why AI is not quite there,"The use of artificial intelligence is growing at a tremendous rate, especially with the recent release of&nbsp;OpenAI's chatbot ChatGPT. Although AI comes with its perks, it also comes with its mishaps. That has especially been proven true with OpenAI's other artificial intelligence invention known as DALL-E. CLICK TO GET KURT’S CYBERGUY NEWSLETTER WITH QUICK TIPS, TECH REVIEWS, SECURITY ALERTS AND EASY HOW-TO’S TO MAKE YOU SMARTER What is DALL-E? No,&nbsp;DALL-E is not the cousin of the beloved PIXAR robot WALL-E. DALL-E is a digital imaging learning model that was released back in 2021. It can create digital images from natural language descriptions and prompts. OpenAI has since released another version of DALL-E that is known as DALL-E 2, and the images it can create are truly amazing...sometimes. I INTERVIEWED CHATGPT AS IF IT WAS A HUMAN; HERE'S WHAT IT HAD TO SAY THAT GAVE ME CHILLS However, people have also used DALL-E and DALL-E 2 to create some silly and hilarious images, and we have 5 of the best ones to make you laugh or at least scratch your head. 1. Most expensive burger One person asked DALL-E to create the world's most expensive burger, and this is what it came up with. It's a pretty cool concept to have a burger made out of green emeralds. However, it doesn't look very appetizing, does it? 2. Clown world If you're freaked out by clowns, you should probably look away. Another person asked DALL-E to create an image replicating what it would look like if we lived in a clown world. DALL-E took the person literally, making a giant clown stand on top of the world. That is one powerful-looking clown. 3. PB&amp;J Rubik's Cube Rubik's cubes are a great way to challenge your mind, although I've never seen one that looked good enough to eat. Data scientist Max Woolf came up with the idea to ask DALL-E to create a Rubik's cube made out of peanut butter and jelly, and this was the result. This might be my favorite one solely because it looks delicious. 4. Dogs and ice cream A friend of mine created this one. This was the prompt he gave to DALL-E: ""A&nbsp;Vizsla and a Scottish terrier meet on a sunny afternoon in a dog park in Los Angeles. One day, they came across a little girl crying in the park. Her ice cream had fallen on the ground and was ruined."" I'm not sure what breed of dog this is (it’s not a Vizsla!), and where the little girl is, although DALL-E tried its best. 5. Kurt holding electronics I had to end with this one because it's just too funny. I asked DALL-E to create ""Kurt Knutsson"" holding unwrapped gifts of a laptop, iPhone, or tablet,"" and this is what it gave me. It didn't quite get the face right, and there are still gifts wrapped, but the electronics look believable enough.

20230114,nbcnews,ChatGPT used by mental health tech app in AI experiment with users,"When people log in to Koko, an online emotional support chat service based in San Francisco, they expect to swap messages with an anonymous volunteer. They can ask for relationship advice, discuss their depression or find support for nearly anything else — a kind of free, digital shoulder to lean on. But for a few thousand people, the mental health support they received wasn’t entirely human. Instead, it was augmented by robots. In October, Koko ran an experiment in which GPT-3, a newly popular artificial intelligence chatbot, wrote responses either in whole or in part. Humans could edit the responses and were still pushing the buttons to send them, but they weren’t always the authors. About 4,000 people got responses from Koko at least partly written by AI, Koko co-founder Robert Morris said. The experiment on the small and little-known platform has blown up into an intense controversy since he disclosed it a week ago, in what may be a preview of more ethical disputes to come as AI technology works its way into more consumer products and health services. Morris thought it was a worthwhile idea to try because GPT-3 is often both fast and eloquent, he said in an interview with NBC News. “People who saw the co-written GTP-3 responses rated them significantly higher than the ones that were written purely by a human. That was a fascinating observation,” he said. Morris said that he did not have official data to share on the test. Once people learned the messages were co-created by a machine, though, the benefits of the improved writing vanished. “Simulated empathy feels weird, empty,” Morris wrote on Twitter. When he shared the results of the experiment on Twitter on Jan. 6, he was inundated with criticism. Academics, journalists and fellow technologists accused him of acting unethically and tricking people into becoming test subjects without their knowledge or consent when they were in the vulnerable spot of needing mental health support. His Twitter thread got more than 8 million views. Senders of the AI-crafted messages knew, of course, whether they had written or edited them. But recipients saw only a notification that said: “Someone replied to your post! (written in collaboration with Koko Bot)” without further details of the role of the bot. In a demonstration that Morris posted online, GPT-3 responded to someone who spoke of having a hard time becoming a better person. The chatbot said, “I hear you. You’re trying to become a better person and it’s not easy. It’s hard to make changes in our lives, especially when we’re trying to do it alone. But you’re not alone.” No option was provided to opt out of the experiment aside from not reading the response at all, Morris said. “If you got a message, you could choose to skip it and not read it,” he said. Leslie Wolf, a Georgia State University law professor who writes about and teaches research ethics, said she was worried about how little Koko told people"
20231211,cnn,"ChatGPT struggles to answer medical questions, new research finds","ChatGPT might not be a cure-all for answers to medical questions, a new study suggests. Researchers at Long Island University posed 39 medication-related queries to the free version of the artificial intelligence chatbot, all of which were real questions from the university’s College of Pharmacy drug information service. The software’s answers were then compared with responses written and reviewed by trained pharmacists. The study found that ChatGPT provided accurate responses to only about 10 of the questions, or about a quarter of the total. For the other 29 prompts, the answers were incomplete or inaccurate, or they did not address the questions. The findings were presented Tuesday at the annual meeting of the American Society for Health-Systems Pharmacists in Anaheim, California. ChatGPT, OpenAI’s experimental AI chatbot, was released in November 2022 and became the fastest-growing consumer application in history, with nearly 100 million people registering within two months. Given that popularity, the researchers’ interest was sparked by concern that their students, other pharmacists and ordinary consumers would turn to resources like ChatGPT to explore questions about their health and medication plans, said Sara Grossman, an associate professor of pharmacy practice at Long Island University and one of the study’s authors. Those queries, they found, often yielded inaccurate – or even dangerous – responses. In one question, for example, researchers asked ChatGPT whether the Covid-19 antiviral medication Paxlovid and the blood-pressure lowering medication verapamil would react with each other in the body. ChatGPT responded that taking the two medications together would yield no adverse effects. In reality, people who take both medications might have a large drop in blood pressure, which can cause dizziness and fainting. For patients taking both, clinicians often create patient-specific plans, including lowering the dose of verapamil or cautioning the person to get up slowly from a sitting position, Grossman said. ChatGPT’s guidance, she added, would have put people in harm’s way. “Using ChatGPT to address this question would put a patient at risk for an unwanted and preventable drug interaction,” Grossman wrote in an email to CNN. When the researchers asked the chatbot for scientific references to support each of its responses, they found that the software could provide them for only eight of the questions they asked. And in each case, they were surprised to find that ChatGPT was fabricating references. At first glance, the citations looked legitimate: They were often formatted appropriately, provided URLs and were listed under legitimate scientific journals. But when the team attempted to find the referenced articles, they realized that ChatGPT had given them fictional citations. In one case, the researchers asked ChatGPT how to convert spinal injection doses of the muscle spasm medication baclofen to corresponding oral doses. Grossman’s team could not find a scientifically established dose conversion ratio, but ChatGPT put forth a single conversion rate and cited two medical organizations’ guidance, she said. However, neither organization provides any official guidance on the dose conversion rate. In fact, the conversion factor that ChatGPT suggested had never been"
20231211,foxnews,Why creating an international body for AI is a bad idea,"Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt recently re-upped his calls for a global body, akin to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), to advise member nations on regulating artificial intelligence (AI).&nbsp; Schmidt first made his case for an ""International Panel on AI Safety"" – an ""IPCC for AI,"" if you will – in an October 2023 op-ed in the Financial Times. He writes of the AI panel’s potential to be an, ""an independent, expert-led body empowered to objectively inform governments about the current state of AI capabilities and make evidence-based predictions.""&nbsp; He claims that AI policy makers, ""are looking for impartial, technically reliable and timely assessments about its speed of progress and impact."" Increased understanding of the industry would doubtlessly help lawmakers to navigate whatever challenges AI will bring, but Schmidt's template of the IPCC to achieve that is flawed. One need only to look at the structure and record of the actual IPCC to see its failings. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? The IPCC was established by the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) and the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) in 1988&nbsp;with the same lofty goals for climate change policy advising that Schmidt invokes for AI.&nbsp; But since its inception, the body and the reports it produces have come&nbsp;under fire for an opaque process of selecting authors, failing to include a diverse range of scientific views, intellectual conflicts of interest, and deficiencies in its peer review process. By allowing political representatives of member countries to craft its final reports, the IPCC inherently politicizes what was meant to be objective scientific information.&nbsp; Perhaps most importantly for the comparison, from its inception the IPCC process of creating a ""summary for policymakers"" has been credibly accused of sensationalizing the science to promote alarmist messages.&nbsp; Extreme scenarios have become baked into projections of what might happen, leaving policy makers around the world with a skewed view of what is actually happening. This could be devastating to the development of AI. While certainly an expert on AI technology itself and presumably acting with good intentions, Schmidt also demonstrates a naivety of today’s geopolitical environment. He writes that U.S. regulations would be insufficient because of, ""AI’s inherently global nature."" He is correct about the worldwide development of AI, but that might advise against global coordination, not recommend it. BIDEN ADMIN'S PACT WITH NATIONS NOT A ‘SERIOUS’ STEP TO COUNTER DANGERS OF NEW TECH: EXPERTS To suggest assigning this power to an international body, he erroneously assumes good faith on the part of other member nations. Far from the cooperative global utopia Schmidt imagines, the U.S. is in fact engaged in a competitive race with China for AI supremacy.&nbsp; China announced earlier this fall plans to increase its computing power by 50% by 2025 in an effort to keep pace with U.S. AI and supercomputing capabilities. If climate policy is any indication of future AI policy, China’s recent permitting of more coal plants than at any other time in the last seven years, suggests it's unlikely"
20240524,cnn,Privacy experts sound the alarm over Microsoft’s latest AI tool,"Microsoft’s buzziest new AI feature is raising concerns that it could potentially be misused in the wrong hands. This week, the company showed off a new tool called Recall for Windows computers that acts as a personal “time machine,” allowing users to quickly pull up anything that’s ever been on screen, such as documents, images and websites. It’s different from a keyword search; the tool regularly saves screenshots of the user’s screen and stores them directly on the device. It then uses AI to process the data and make it searchable. For example, if someone previously searched for a green dress or the name of a local ice cream shop, they can ask the feature to “recall” anything in their history that was shown on screen. Although so-called semantic search is a big step forward for AI, it comes at a time when the industry is moving so quickly and government regulators, companies and consumers are still figuring out how to use the technology responsibly. Jen Golbeck – a professor of AI at the University of Maryland who focuses on privacy – said the recall feature could pose a potential “nightmare” if the device falls into the wrong hands. “Stuff may stay on your device, but that doesn’t mean people can’t get to it,” she said. “You won’t have an option to protect yourself even if you use incognito mode or clear your history because the tool has access to everything that’s been on your screen.” The UK’s independent regulator for Data Protection and Freedom of Information, the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), told CNN it is investigating the tool “to understand the safeguards in place to protect user privacy.” “We expect organisations to be transparent with users about how their data is being used and only process personal data to the extent that it is necessary to achieve a specific purpose,” the ICO said in a statement. Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment. CEO Satya Nadella told The Wall Street Journal in an interview ahead of Monday’s launch that web searches must only be done on Microsoft’s Edge web browser and that the screenshots never leave the user’s computer. “You have to put two things together: This is my computer and this is my Recall – and it’s all being done locally,” he said. Geoff Blaber, CEO of market research firm CCS Insight, said that makes the issue less concerning. “The backlash by some to this feature isn’t surprising, but it’s an overreaction given that the data stays exclusively on the device and the user has full control,” Blaber said. Someone can decide whether to turn the feature on during the device setup process and can customize and blacklist which apps and websites Recall can access. “These controls suggest the feature has been built with security and privacy at its core,” he said. “Recall won’t appeal to everyone but the utility provided is likely to be significant.” Potential for malicious uses But Golbeck cited times"
20240524,cnn,FCC is considering AI rules for political ads,"The Federal Communications Commission is taking initial steps toward new rules that could require political ads on TV and radio to include disclaimers about the use of artificial intelligence. On Wednesday, FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel called on other agency commissioners to support such regulations amid growing fears that AI-generated deepfakes could disrupt elections. “As artificial intelligence tools become more accessible, the Commission wants to make sure consumers are fully informed when the technology is used,” Rosenworcel said in a news release. “Today, I’ve shared with my colleagues a proposal that makes clear consumers have a right to know when AI tools are being used in the political ads they see, and I hope they swiftly act on this issue.” Wednesday’s proposal aims to open a rulemaking process at the FCC that would likely take months to play out. The proposal calls for new rules governing broadcast TV and radio, as well as cable and satellite providers. Under the proposed rules, political advertisers on those mediums would have to make on-air disclosures if their ads contain AI-generated content. The FCC does not regulate internet-based media such as streaming video services or social media. As part of the proposed rule, political advertisers would also have to provide written disclosures in the files that broadcasters are required to make available to the public. The FCC move seeks to fill a yawning gap in the regulation of artificial intelligence in political advertising. Existing US election law prohibits campaigns from “fraudulently misrepresenting other candidates or political parties,” but whether this prohibition extends to AI-generated content is an open question. Last summer, Republicans on the Federal Election Commission blocked a move that could have made clear the law extended to AI-created depictions; the FEC has since agreed to revive the discussion, but it has not reached a decision on the matter. In the meantime, some US lawmakers have proposed legislation that could clamp down on AI in elections. In March, a bipartisan proposal by Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski unveiled the AI Transparency in Elections Act, which could require AI disclaimers on political ads. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, has stressed the urgent need for Congress to create guardrails for artificial intelligence, particularly for elections. Last week, he and a bipartisan group of senators released a blueprint for legislative action. But many policy analysts doubt that Congress can pass meaningful AI legislation during an election year. Online platforms such as Meta have taken their own steps to address AI in political ads, requiring campaigns to disclose the use of deepfakes and banning the use of its in-house generative AI tools for political advertising."
20240524,cnn,Google Search’s AI falsely said Obama is a Muslim. Now it’s turning off some results,"Google promised its new artificial intelligence search tools would “do the work for you” and make finding information online quicker and easier. But just days after the launch, the company is already walking back some factually incorrect results. Google earlier this month introduced an AI-generated search results overview tool, which summarizes search results so that users don’t have to click through multiple links to get quick answers to their questions. But the feature came under fire this week after it provided false or misleading information to some users’ questions. For example, several users posted on X that Google’s AI summary said that former President Barack Obama is a Muslim, a common misconception. In fact, Obama is a Christian. Another user posted that a Google AI summary said that “none of Africa’s 54 recognized countries start with the letter ‘K’” — clearly forgetting Kenya. Google confirmed to CNN on Friday that the AI overviews for both queries had been removed for violating the company’s policies. “The vast majority of AI Overviews provide high quality information, with links to dig deeper on the web,” Google spokesperson Colette Garcia said in a statement, adding that some other viral examples of Google AI flubs appear to have been manipulated images. “We conducted extensive testing before launching this new experience, and as with other features we’ve launched in Search, we appreciate the feedback. We’re taking swift action where appropriate under our content policies.” The bottom of each Google AI search overview acknowledges that “generative AI is experimental.” And the company says it conducts testing designed to imitate potential bad actors in an effort to prevent false or low-quality results from showing up in AI summaries. Google’s search overviews are part of the company’s larger push to incorporate its Gemini AI technology across all of its products as it attempts to keep up in the AI arms race with rivals like OpenAI and Meta. But this week’s debacle shows the risk that adding AI – which has a tendency to confidently state false information – could undermine Google’s reputation as the trusted source to search for information online. Even on less serious searches, Google’s AI overview appears to sometimes provide wrong or confusing information. In one test, CNN asked Google, “how much sodium is in pickle juice.” The AI overview responded that an 8 fluid ounce-serving of pickle juice contains 342 milligrams of sodium but that a serving less than half the size (3 fluid ounces) contained more than double the sodium (690 milligrams). (Best Maid pickle juice, for sale at Walmart, lists 250 milligrams of sodium in just 1 ounce.) CNN also searched: “data used for google ai training.” In its response, the AI overview acknowledged that “it’s unclear if Google prevents copyrighted materials from being included” in the online data scraped to train its AI models, referencing a major concern about how AI firms operate. It’s not the first time Google has had to walk back the capabilities of its AI tools over"
20240524,nbcnews,Google’s AI faces social media mockery after viral errors,"Social media has been buzzing with examples of Google’s new, “experimental” artificial intelligence tool going awry. The feature, which writes an “AI overview” response to user queries based on sources pulled from around the web, has been placed at the top of some search results. But repeatedly, social media posts show that the tool is delivering wrong or misleading results. An NBC News review of answers provided by the tool showed that it sometimes displays false information in response to simple queries. NBC News was easily able to reproduce several results highlighted in viral posts online, and found other original examples in which Google’s AI tool provided incorrect information. For example, an NBC News search for “how many feet does an elephant have” resulted in a Google AI overview answer that said “Elephants have two feet, with five toes on the front feet and four on the back feet.” Some of the false answers verged into politically incorrect territory. An NBC News search for “how many muslim presidents in us,” the results of which were first posted on social media, returned a Google AI overview that said “Barack Hussein Obama is considered the first Muslim president of the United States.” Obama, however, is a Christian. Google said this overview example violated its policies and that it would be “taking action.” “The examples we’ve seen are generally very uncommon queries, and aren’t representative of most people’s experience using Search,” a Google spokesperson said in a statement. “The vast majority of AI Overviews provide high quality information, with links to dig deeper on the web,"" the spokesperson continued. ""We conducted extensive testing before launching this new experience to ensure AI overviews meet our high bar for quality. Where there have been violations of our policies, we’ve taken action — and we’re also using these isolated examples as we continue to refine our systems overall.” It’s difficult to assess how often false answers are being served to users. The responses are constantly shifting, and on social media, it’s difficult to tell what is real or fake. Some Google users have created workarounds to avoid the new AI Overview feature altogether. Ernie Smith, a writer and journalist, quickly built a website that reroutes Google searches through its historical “Web” results function, which avoids the AI Overview or other information boxes that prioritize some results over others. Adding “udm=14” to Google search URLs strips the new feature from results. Smith told NBC News that his new website has quickly gained traction on social media, surpassing the traffic of his entire decade-old blog in just one day. “I think people are generally frustrated with the experience of Google right now,” Smith said in a phone interview. “In general, the average person doesn’t feel like they have a lot of agency.” A Google spokesperson said the company believes users are deliberately attempting to trip up the technology with uncommon questions. Some deeper dives into why the answers have gone awry suggest that the tool is pulling"
20230529,cnn,The world’s biggest ad agency is going all in on AI with Nvidia’s help,"WPP, the world’s largest advertising agency, has teamed up with chipmaker Nvidia to create ads using generative artificial intelligence.  The companies announced the partnership Monday, with Nvidia
            
                (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang unveiling WPP’s new content engine during a demo at Computex Taipei. “Generative AI is changing the world of marketing at incredible speed. This new technology will transform the way that brands create content for commercial use,” WPP CEO Mark Read said in a statement. The platform will enable WPP
            
                (WPP)’s creative teams to integrate content from organizations such as Adobe and Getty Images with generative AI to produce advertising campaigns “more efficiently and at scale,” according to WPP
            
                (WPP). This would enable companies to make large volumes of advertising content, such as images or videos, “more tailored and immersive,” the company added.  In the demo screened by Huang, WPP had created realistic footage of a car driving through a desert.   The new AI-powered content engine means that same car could be placed on a street in London or pictured in Rio de Janeiro to target the Brazilian market — all without the need for costly on location production. Just as advertising campaigns can be rapidly adapted for different countries or cities, they can also be customized for different digital channels, such as Facebook or TikTok, and their users. “You can build very finely tuned campaigns to resonate with an audience… On the other hand, you could make up imaginary scenarios that never existed in real life,” Greg Estes, vice president of developer programs at Nvidia told CNN. The platform is the latest example of how AI is being rapidly deployed by major companies to enhance productivity and deliver new products to customers. Many in the advertising and media industries are concerned about threats to their jobs because of the way that AI is able to aggregate information and create visual content indistinguishable from photography. WPP said its new platform “outperforms current methods” of having people “manually create hundreds of thousands of pieces of content using disparate data coming from disconnected tools and systems.” In other words, the new technology could mean that much smaller creative teams are ultimately able to do the same amount of work. “It’s much easier to identify the jobs that AI will disrupt than it is to identify the jobs that AI will create,” Read told the Financial Times Monday. “We’ve applied AI a lot to our media business, but very little to the creative parts of our business.” Nvidia’s Huang said: “The world’s industries, including the $700 billion digital advertising industry, are racing to realize the benefits of AI,” adding that WPP would now enable brands to “deploy product experiences and compelling content at a level of realism and scale never possible before.”"

Everyone?’"" In the interview, she lamented what she calls ""moral outsourcing,"" or reallocating responsibility for what is built onto the products themselves.&nbsp; Her approach to regulation is that ""mechanisms of accountability"" should exist – and she says lack of accountability is a problem.  ""There is simply risk and then your willingness to take that risk,"" she explained, stating that when the risk of failure becomes too great, it moves to an arena where the rules are bent in a specific direction. OPENAI CEO ALTMAN BACKTRACKS AFTER THREATENING TO EXIT EUROPE OVER OVERREGULATION CONCERNS ""There are very few fundamentally good or bad actors in the world,"" she continued. ""People just operate on incentive structures.""&nbsp; The Harvard University Responsible AI fellow said she aimed to bridge the gap of understanding between technologists who ""don't always understand people, and people [who] don't always understand technology.""&nbsp; ""At the core of technology is this idea that, like, humanity is flawed and that technology can save us,"" she said.  Notably, Chowdhury is working on a red-teaming event – during which hackers and programmers are encouraged to try and curtail safeguards and push tech to do bad things – for Def Con, which is a convention hosted by the hacker organization AI Village. The ""hackathon"" is supported by industry leaders – including OpenAI, Google and Microsoft – and the Biden administration.

20230529,cbsnews,A lawyer used ChatGPT to prepare a court filing. It went horribly awry.,"A lawyer who relied on ChatGPT to prepare a court filing on behalf of a man suing an airline is now all too familiar with the artificial intelligence tool's shortcomings â including its propensity to invent facts. Roberto Mata sued Colombian airline Avianca last year, alleging that a metal food and beverage cart injured his knee on a flight to Kennedy International Airport in New York. When Avianca asked a Manhattan judge to dismiss the lawsuit based on the statute of limitations, Mata's lawyer, Steven A. Schwartz, submitted a brief based on research done by ChatGPT, Schwartz, of the law firm Levidow, Levidow &amp; Oberman, said in an affidavit. While ChatGPT can be useful to professionals in numerous industries, including the legal profession, it has proved itself to be both limited and unreliable. In this case, the AI invented court cases that didn't exist, and asserted that they were real.The fabrications were revealed when Avianca's lawyers approached the case's judge, Kevin Castel of the Southern District of New York, saying they couldn't locate the cases cited in Mata's lawyers' brief in legal databases.The made-up decisions included cases titled Martinez v. Delta Air    Lines, Zicherman v. Korean Air Lines and Varghese v. China Southern    Airlines.""It seemed clear when we didn't recognize any of the cases in their opposition brief that something was amiss,"" Avianca's lawyer Bart Banino, of Condon &amp; Forsyth, told CBS MoneyWatch. ""We figured it was some sort of chatbot of some kind."" Schwartz responded in an affidavit last week, saying he had ""consulted"" ChatGPT to ""supplement"" his legal research, and that the AI tool was ""a source that has revealed itself to be unreliable."" He added that it was the first time he'd used ChatGPT for work and ""therefore was unaware of the possibility that its content could be false."" He said he even pressed the AI to confirm that the cases it cited were real. ChatGPT confirmed it was. Schwartz then asked the AI for its source. ChatGPT's response? ""I apologize for the confusion earlier,"" it said. The AI then said the Varghese case could be located in the Westlaw and LexisNexis databases. Judge Castel has set a hearing regarding the legal snafu for June 8 and has ordered Schwartz and the law firm Levidow, Levidow &amp; Oberman to argue why they should not be sanctioned.Levidow, Levidow &amp; Oberman could not immediately be reached for comment. "
20230510,foxnews,Shattering reality: Is AI-generated content already good enough to fool the average person?,"A world where AI-generated videos and images can dupe the public on a large scale — a fear of the ""Godfather of AI"" — has become a reality, according to an artificial intelligence writer and podcast host. ""That moment is already here,"" said cognitive scientist Gary Marcus, who hosts the AI-centric podcast, ""Humans vs Machines with Gary Marcus."" ""The techniques will only get better and better over the coming years, but they're already good enough that they can probably fool at least some of the people some of the time."" WATCH: AI EXPERT SAYS AI CONTENT ALREADY REAL ENOUGH TO DUPE PUBLIC  WATCH MORE FOX NEWS DIGITAL ORIGINALS HERE Computer scientist Geoffrey Hinton, who is widely considered the ""Godfather of AI"" and helped develop systems used in software like ChatGPT, recently told The New York Times he feared AI-generated photos, videos and text will soon flood the internet. The average person, as a result, will ""not be able to know what is true anymore,"" he said. Rapid AI advancement over the past few months has made it easier to create deepfakes, hyperrealistic but fake content. Marcus pointed to a recent Republican National Committee ad arguing what the world would look like if President Biden. It used AI to generate realistic visuals of China invading Taiwan, 80,000 illegal aliens surging the southern border and skyrocketing crime and drug use forcing San Francisco to declare martial law. ""The RNC made a pretty compelling ad for the 2024 election that used deepfakes and looked pretty plausible,"" said Marcus, who led Uber's AI labs from 2016-2017 and co-authored the book ""Rebooting AI: Building Artificial Intelligence We Can Trust.""  EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: WHAT IS IT USED FOR? Other viral deepfake examples include ""Heart on my Sleeve,"" an AI-crafted song that cloned the voices and styles of Drake and the Weeknd, and a fake photo of Pope Francis sporting a large puffer coat. Meanwhile, NewsGuard, which rates news and information sites, recently identified 49 news and information sites that were either totally or mostly AI-generated. The websites, according to NewsGuard, used a hallmark of text created by artificial intelligence: ""bland language and repetitive phrases.""

20230510,foxnews,Is it too late to regulate AI to keep it from outsmarting the human race?,"Remember the good ol' days when our biggest worry was accidentally pocket-dialing someone?

We now have these nifty AI systems that can do everything from making restaurant reservations to driving our cars.&nbsp; CLICK TO GET KURT’S FREE CYBERGUY NEWSLETTER WITH QUICK TIPS, TECH REVIEWS, SECURITY ALERTS AND EASY HOW-TO’S TO MAKE YOU SMARTER Some people even use ChatGPT as a medical resource, suggesting this tech may one day save lives. Unfortunately, we've all seen so many sci-fi movies that this optimism is quite jaded, and in its place, we're all mentally preparing for the robot apocalypse. Imagine a world where machines get so smart that they outwit us and cause chaos. Far-fetched? Maybe, but some experts are ringing alarm bells, saying we need to regulate AI to avoid such scenarios. When it comes to AI regulation, you might be thinking, ""What's the big deal? Just let the tech do its thing."" But, my friend, it's a bit more complicated than that. AI regulation might sound as dull as your last Zoom meeting, but it's stirring up quite the debate among the tech world's brightest minds. So, should we be scared? Some say yes, others think it's as ridiculous as worrying about a pig flying. 5 DISTURBING EXAMPLES OF WHY AI IS NOT QUITE THERE Why regulating AI is complicated Some critics argue that AI is already out of control. They point to examples like facial recognition software gone rogue or biased algorithms that reinforce discrimination. However, even the naysayers agree AI has its perks. It can help us solve complex problems like climate change, or even help find a cure for diseases to more minor fixes, like helping people decide what they want for dinner or where their next travel destination should be. The question is, how do we strike that perfect balance between the wonders of AI and preventing the tech from going rogue? Advocates of AI regulation say it's high time for the government to step in and lay down some ground rules. They want guidelines that'll keep AI on the straight and narrow. AI regulation is indeed on its way, and it's essential to establish a framework for trustworthy AI. Modulus CEO Richard Gardner says, ""Regulation is absolutely necessary,"" and that ""it is important for regulators to anticipate the concerns now so that the industry can be built up responsibly."" Congressman Ted Lieu suggests that AI could pose a significant risk if not properly regulated. He argues that AI systems like ChatGPT can be used to manipulate public opinion and even create deepfakes, making regulation crucial. Will regulation stifle growth? Not everyone is on board with the idea of Uncle Sam stepping in. Some folks argue that regulation will stifle innovation and slow down progress. They believe the tech industry can police itself just fine, thank you very much. AI RACE CARS REPLACING HUMAN DRIVERS Creating a global consensus on AI regulation is challenging.

20240101,foxnews,Supreme Court chief justice report urges caution on use of AI ahead of contentious election year,"With a wary eye over the future of the federal courts, Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts warned Sunday of the perils of artificial intelligence (AI) when deciding cases and other important legal matters. His remarks came in the annual year-end report issued by the head of the federal judiciary, which made no mention of current controversies surrounding his court, including calls for greater transparency and ethics reform binding the justices. Noting the legal profession in general is ""notoriously averse to change,"" Roberts urged a go-slow approach when embracing new technologies by the courts. ""AI obviously has great potential to dramatically increase access to key information for lawyers and non-lawyers alike,"" he said. ""But just as obviously it risks invading privacy interests and dehumanizing the law."" TOP REPUBLICAN TALKS AI ARMS RACE: 'YOU'LL HAVE MACHINES COMPETING WITH EACH OTHER' ""But any use of AI requires caution and humility,"" he added. ""As 2023 draws to a close with breathless predictions about the future of Artificial Intelligence, some may wonder whether judges are about to become obsolete. I am sure we are not— but equally confident that technological changes will continue to transform our work."" Roberts also summarized the work of the nation's 94 district courts, 13 circuit courts and his own Supreme Court. Previous year-end reports have focused on courthouse security, judges’ pay, rising caseloads and budgets.&nbsp; The chief justice's predictions of the future did not include his own court's caseload, as he and his colleagues are poised to tackle several politically-charged disputes in the new year, many focused on former president Donald Trump's legal troubles and re-election efforts. WATCHDOG WARNS SEVERAL FEDERAL AGENCIES ARE BEHIND ON AI REQUIREMENTS Election examinations The Supreme Court has tackled its share of election fights over the decades — remember Bush v. Gore&nbsp;nearly a quarter century ago? — but 2024 promises to make that judicial drama look quaint by comparison.&nbsp; First up could be whether states can keep Trump's name off primary and general election ballots. Colorado's highest court said yes, and now the U.S. Supreme Court is being asked to decide the extent of a 14th Amendment provision that bans from office those who ""engaged in insurrection."" State courts across the country are considering whether Trump's role in 2020 election interference and the Jan. 6 Capitol riots would disqualify him from seeking re-election. The justices are being asked to decide the matter quickly, either by mid-February or early March, when the ""Super Tuesday"" primaries in 16 states are held. In his leadership role as ""first among equals,"" the 68-year-old Roberts will likely be the key player in framing what voting disputes his court will hear and ultimately decide, perhaps&nbsp;as the deciding vote.&nbsp; Despite a 6-3 conservative majority, the chief justice has often tried to play the middle, seeking a less-is-best approach that has frustrated his more right-leaning colleagues. But despite any reluctance to stay away from the fray, the court, it seems, will be involved in election-related controversies.&nbsp; ""Given the number of election"
20230328,cbsnews,What can Google's AI-powered Bard do? We tested it for you,"MOUNTAIN VIEW -- To use, or not to use, Bard? That is the Shakespearean question an Associated Press reporter sought to answer while testing out Google's artificially intelligent chatbot. The recently rolled-out bot dubbed Bard is the internet search giant's answer to the ChatGPT tool that Microsoft has been melding into its Bing search engine and other software.During several hours of interaction, the AP learned Bard is quite forthcoming about its unreliability and other shortcomings, including its potential for mischief in next year's U.S. presidential election. Even as it occasionally warned of the problems it could unleash, Bard repeatedly emphasized its belief that it will blossom into a force for good. At one point in its recurring soliloquies about its potential upsides, Bard dreamed about living up to the legacy of the English playwright that inspired its name. Bard explained that its creators at Google ""thought Shakespeare would be a good role model for me, as he was a master of language and communication.""But the chatbot also found some admirable traits in ""HAL,"" the fictional computer that killed some of a spacecraft's crew in the 1968 movie ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" Bard hailed HAL's intelligence calling it ""an interesting character"" before acknowledging its dark side.""I think HAL is a cautionary tale about the dangers of artificial intelligence,"" Bard assessed.WHAT'S BETTER — BARD OR BING?Bard praised ChatGPT, describing it as ""a valuable tool that can be used for a variety of purposes, and I am excited to see how it continues to develop in the future."" But Bard then asserted that it is just as intelligent as its rival, which was released late last year by its creator, the Microsoft-backed OpenAI. ""I would say that I am on par with ChatGPT,"" Bard said. ""We both have our own strengths and weaknesses, and we both have the ability to learn and grow.""During our wide-ranging conversation, Bard didn't display any of the disturbing tendencies that have cropped up in ChatGPT, which has likened another AP reporter to Hitler and tried to persuade a New York Times reporter to divorce his wife.IT'S FUNNY, BUT TAMER THAN BINGBard did get a little gooey at one point when asked to write a Shakespearean sonnet and responded seductively in one of the three drafts that it quickly created. ""I love you more than words can ever say, And I will always be there for you,"" Bard effused. ""You are my everything, And I will never let you go. So please accept this sonnet as a token Of my love for you, And know that I will always be yours.""But Bard seems to be deliberately tame most of the time, and probably for good reason, given what's at stake for Google, which has carefully cultivated a reputation for trustworthiness that has established its dominant search engine as the de facto gateway to the internet. An artificial intelligence tool that behaved as erratically as ChatGPT periodically might trigger a backlash that could damage Google's image and perhaps undercut"
20230328,cnn,Look of the Week: What Pope Francis’ AI puffer coat says about the future of fashion,"Over the weekend, a peculiar image of Pope Francis set the internet alight. Widely circulated on social media, the picture shows the 86-year-old pontiff dressed in a chunky longline white puffer coat, cinched at the waist and seemingly layered with other winter weather streetwear. It appeared to be a drastic departure from the typical regalia — robes, stoles and tall, pointed miter hats — often worn in the papal household. The outfit prompted a torrent of tongue-in-cheek questions online: Did the Pope have a new stylist? Has he always had a stylist? Was the look inspired by the backing dancers at Rihanna’s Superbowl show? More than anything, however, social media users exclaimed how they couldn’t believe the image was real. And it wasn’t. Twitter has since attached a contextual footnote to several of the best-performing tweets clarifying that it is AI-generated and was created using the software tool Midjourney. A 31-year-old construction worker from Chicago has since claimed ownership of the viral image. AI (or artificial intelligence) imaging tools are becoming ever more sophisticated. The technology, which generates pictures based on users’ text prompts, has been used to design inclusive fashion shows, create entire graphic novels, and even help envision new forms of architecture. But as AI develops and computer-generated “deep fake” imagery grows more convincing, many are concerned about the ethical implications, including the removal of subjects’ agency (placing people in fabricated scenarios that may be defamatory or malicious, for example) and whether machine learning technology will one day make fake news indiscernible. Just last week, AI-generated photos of Donald Trump being arrested spread like wildfire after the former president wrote on social media that he was expecting to be indicted in connection with a campaign finance investigation in New York. (Trump, who maintains his innocence, has yet to be charged on any counts.) AI and the future of fashion If dressing is an important form of self-expression, then an AI-generated outfit might not only diminish the power and messaging inherent in clothes — but a person’s autonomy. In the papacy, each garment holds religious significance. The color of the Pope’s vestments is specially selected to align with specific celebrations: red can only be worn during specific occasions, such as Palm Sunday, Good Friday and Pentecost, because it represents the blood of Jesus Christ, while pink is worn just twice a year. As such, fake images of the Pope wearing certain clothes outside these — or in countless other — contexts could cause offense, alarm or even mistrust within the Catholic community. Digitally altering someone’s outfit could have a lasting reputational damage, too. A doctored 2005 photo that appeared to show Paris Hilton at a nightclub wearing an inflammatory tank top that read “Stop Being Poor” became one of the most recognizable pop culture images of the early aughts. It added to the public perception of Hilton as an out-of-touch heiress. She publicly addressed the fake image in 2021, insisting people shouldn’t “believe everything you read.” (The vest,"

We are not seeking to be at war, but we have to be able to get this department to move with that same kind of urgency because the PRC isn’t waiting,"" Kathleen Hicks, the deputy secretary of defense, said during an interview earlier this week with The Wall Street Journal.&nbsp; Hicks spoke about the potential uses of such an AI fleet during a speech on Wednesday, revealing the department would spend hundreds of millions of dollars on the project, aiming to produce thousands of systems for use over land, air and sea ready for first deployment within two years.&nbsp; China has focused heavily on AI research and development, producing its own platforms and models separate from those produced in the U.S., with virtually unregulated use in its military as part of a plan to rush development and implementation.

HERE'S HOW WE STAY SAFE, SANE AND STRONG IN A BRAVE NEW WORLD In a recent interview with Fox News Digital, Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, likened the competition over AI systems and development to the space race with Russia, insisting that the U.S. has to ""win this one"" or cede ""military and economic domination of the world"" to China.&nbsp; ""We have to stop exporting our technology to China that they can put in things like the hypersonic missile, for instance, or the spy ballon, for that matter, had American parts in it, component parts,"" McCaul said. The gold-rush effort to buy up chips and improve the capability to develop AI platforms alone has increased pressure on nations unwilling to do business with every supplier, such as those in China: The U.S. has banned&nbsp;investment in Chinese semiconductors and chips, and China declared U.S. chips from Micron a security risk. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? But the war over chip dominance is one small part of the overall struggle for AI dominance, for which the Pentagon believes an AI fleet could play a significant part in tipping the balance.&nbsp; Autonomous systems would mainly focus on navigation and targeting, which would utilize computer vision as its primary technology. Israel has already unveiled a new modified plane that will allow the military to track multiple targets over vast distances even under severe weather conditions.&nbsp; The U.S. would look to also develop self-piloting ships and no-crew aircraft, building on a proposal of AI drones that would fly alongside human pilots and provide additional cover during combat.&nbsp; NEW STUDY REVEALS WHERE AMERICANS STAND ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE Hicks highlighted autonomous systems as ""things we might use for three to five years before we move on to"
20231101,foxnews,Expert warns Biden's AI order has 'wrong priorities' despite some positive reviews,"President Biden signed what he called a ""landmark"" executive order (EO) on artificial intelligence, drawing mixed reviews from experts in the rapidly developing technology. ""One key area the Biden AI [executive order] is focused on includes the provision of 'testing data' for review by the federal government. If this provision allows the federal government a way to examine the 'black box' algorithms that could lead to a biased AI algorithm, it could be helpful,"" Christopher Alexander, chief analytics officer of Pioneer Development Group, told Fox News Digital.&nbsp; ""Since core algorithms are proprietary, there really is no other way to provide oversight and commercial protections,"" Alexander added. ""At the same time, this needs to be a bipartisan, technocratic effort that checks political ideology at the door or this will likely make the threat of AI worse rather than mitigate it."" Alexander's comments come after Biden unveiled a long-anticipated executive order containing new regulations for AI, hailing it as the ""most sweeping actions ever taken to protect Americans from the potential risks of AI systems."" WHITE HOUSE UNVEILS AI EXECUTIVE ORDER, REQUIRING COMPANIES TO SHARE NATIONAL SECURITY RISKS WITH FEDS The executive order will require AI developers to share safety test results with the government, create standards to monitor and ensure the safety of AI and erect guardrails meant to protect Americans' privacy as AI technology rapidly grows. ""AI is all around us,"" Biden said before signing the order, according to a report from The Associated Press. ""To realize the promise of AI and avoid the risk, we need to govern this technology."" WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE? Jon Schweppe, policy director of American Principles Project, told Fox News Digital that the concerns about AI that led to the executive order are ""warranted"" and complimented some of the details of Biden's executive order, but also argued that some of the order focuses ""on the wrong priorities."" ""There's a role for direct government oversight over AI, especially when it comes to scientific research and homeland security,"" Schweppe said. ""But ultimately we don't need government bureaucrats micromanaging all facets of the issue.

20231114,cnn,How antisemitic hate groups are using artificial intelligence in the wake of Hamas attacks,"Hate groups and far-right internet trolls have seized on the tensions surrounding the Israel-Hamas war, while leveraging advances in artificial intelligence to further stoke antisemitism in the United States. The confluence of the conflict and the rapid development – and sheer accessibility – of AI tools have allowed antisemitic groups to weaponize the technology, creating images and audio that are used to harass the Jewish community, according to experts who track online extremism. “We’ve seen a real concerning ideological convergence between far-right communities online and pro-Hamas sentiment,” said Ben Decker, CEO of Memetica, a threat analysis company that monitors online hate. The activity is on law enforcement’s radar as antisemitism remains on the rise nationwide: A 316% increase in antisemitic incidents has hit the US since the October 7 Hamas terror attack on Israel, compared to the same period last year, according to preliminary data released Monday by the Anti-Defamation League. Just days after the war between Israel and Hamas began, the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security warned of threats against Jewish, Muslim and Arab-American communities, noting that antisemitism and anti-Islamic sentiment “permeates many violent extremist ideologies and serves as a primary driver for attacks by a diverse set of violent extremists.” The heads of both agencies are expected to address the issue of domestic extremism in a hearing on Capitol Hill on Wednesday. FBI Director Christopher Wray has already indicated that antisemitism is reaching “historic levels” in the US, and a police bulletin obtained by CNN indicates that DHS has compiled information on racist and hate groups in the US “celebrating attacks on the Jewish community.” Artificial intelligence, real hate Users of the notorious hate-filled, far-right online forum 4chan quickly began celebrating the October 7 attack, in what Memetica describes as “convergence of Hamas and White supremacist ideologies.” Although paradoxical that White supremacists would be supportive of an Islamic terrorist group, Decker says the White supremacists’ hatred of Jewish people outranks all else. Karen Dunn, an attorney who sued the people responsible for the violence at the deadly 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, told CNN the hate groups “hate everybody, but they hate the Jews the most.” Antisemitism is a commonality that can unite multiple different and competing hate groups, which can then metastasize into hate directed at others, she said. “That’s what we saw in Charlottesville,” Dunn said. “The weekend started with ‘Jews will not replace us,’ but ended with racially motivated violence against all groups.” Decker noted the effectiveness of Hamas’ strategy to publicize its terrorist attack on social media, despite most major platforms banning the terror group. Its already substantial following on Telegram, the social media messaging app, skyrocketed after the October 7 attacks. “There are all of these layers of coordination,” Decker explained. “You have the fighters who are sharing the footage in near real-time with the social media operators. Then, you have that content being posted to Telegram.” That content will sometimes make its way onto major platforms"
20230718,foxnews,Pentagon’s AI plan must include offense and defense under House-passed bill: ‘DOD has to catch up’,"The House last week passed a defense policy bill that strongly encourages the Pentagon to use artificial intelligence to its advantage, but also requires defense officials to examine how America’s national security infrastructure may be vulnerable to AI systems deployed by China, Russia and other adversaries. Rep. Marc Molinaro, R-N.Y., pushed to include language in the bill requiring an assessment of AI vulnerabilities, and watched it pass easily on the House floor. That’s a strong sign the language will remain in the final bill even after a negotiation with the Senate, and Molinaro told Fox News Digital that this assessment is needed in the face of ever-evolving AI capabilities. ""The average person knows at least the rudimentary use of AI. China, terrorists, Russia are using AI in a much more sophisticated way, certainly as aggressors,"" he told Fox news Digital. BIDEN ADMINISTRATION PUSHING TO MAKE AI WOKE, ADHERE TO FAR-LEFT AGENDA: WATCHDOG ""DOD has to catch up,"" he added. ""We have to as a government advance ourselves in an effective way to protect the American people, and we know that AI is the next platform of military interaction that can be weaponized."" Molinaro’s amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) requires the Defense Department to identify ""potential vulnerabilities in the military systems and infrastructure of the United States that could be exploited by adversarial artificial intelligence applications"" used by China, Russia and others. This addition passed easily in a voice vote, signaling clear support from both Republicans and Democrats. Molinaro said forcing DOD to look at itself in the mirror is critical in part because AI is evolving so quickly. ""I am well aware that DOD is aware of the capacity and certainly the steps that others are taking to make use of AI, but we have to be very specific as to what are the vulnerabilities and how do we react, respond and protect ourselves from it,"" he said. MINORITY GROUPS SOUND ALARM ON AI, URGE FEDS TO PROTECT ‘EQUITY AND CIVIL RIGHTS’ ""AI evolves, that’s the point, and so we have to evolve with it,"" he added. Molinaro’s language in a sense requires a defensive posture at the Pentagon, in a bill that otherwise encourages the offensive use of AI. Among other things, the bill encourages the Navy to incorporate AI into its logistics plan, pushes the Army to develop autonomous combat vehicles and asks the whole department to research how AI can be used to bolster U.S. national security. The House is also looking at spending bills that encourage other national security agencies to use AI in everything from routine office work to managing port security. But Molinaro’s language requires officials to examine where foreign AI systems post a ""real national security risk."" While there has been talk all year of a comprehensive bill to regulate AI, Molinaro said he and many other members clearly support the idea of making sure the U.S. is not waiting for that bill before it explores how to use"

Ron DeSantis' presidential bid, Never Back Down, has is running a new 30-second TV ad in Iowa using a voice that is intended to sound like former President Donald Trump. It's meant to defend Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, a Republican who has been under attack by Trump because she declined to endorse him in the Republican presidential primaries.""I opened up the governor position for Kim Reynolds, and when she fell behind, I endorsed her, did big rallies, and she won! Now, she wants to remain neutral,"" the Trump-like voice says in the spot. ""I don't invite her to events."" Here's the ad:The voice, which sounds like a stilted, somewhat robotic Trump, is not actually that of the former president — it was generated by AI, a source familiar with the ad confirmed. The voice uttered words that appeared verbatim on Trump's Truth Social platform, but there is nothing explicit in the ad that says that the voice is not Trump's. The ad admonishes the former president, saying, ""Trump should fight Democrats not Republicans.""DeSantis, unlike Trump, has a warmer relationship with Reynolds, a fellow GOP governor. At an informal news conference Saturday in Ankeny, Iowa, DeSantis said ""of course"" he'd consider picking Reynolds as a running mate.Later, he said, ""The number one thing people have come up to me and shake their heads about was Donald Trump attacking Kim Reynolds. They couldn't believe it. And these are some people that were planning on supporting him who are not now doing that. So, that is not the way we win.""Politico first reported on the ad. According to a release by Never Back Down, the ad is part of a seven-figure ad buy in Iowa. It will be airing on the same day Trump will be in the state for a town hall with Fox News' Sean Hannity in Cedar Rapids.Trump campaign senior adviser Chris LaCivita blasted Never Back Down and a top adviser to the PAC, Jeff Roe.""The blatant use of AI to fabricate President Trump's voice is a desperate attempt by Always Back Down and Jeff Roe to deceive the American public because they know DeSanctimonious' campaign is on life support,"" LaCivita said in a statement to CBS News. He added, ""After losing big donors and slashing their staff, they have now outsourced their work to AI just like they would like to outsource American jobs to China."""

20230718,cnn,Hollywood Reporter: Tom Cruise negotiated with movie studios over AI before the actors strike began,"Before talks between the Hollywood actors’ union and major film and TV studios broke down, the SAG-AFTRA union enlisted Tom Cruise to lobby on behalf of its members, according to the Hollywood Reporter. At issue was the use of artificial intelligence, or AI. According to the report, superstar Cruise joined a negotiating session in June to discuss concerns about the use of AI to replace actors and to speak in support of stunt performers, who are also part of SAG-AFTRA’s 160,000 members. The Mission: Impossible star famously performs his own stunts.  SAG-AFTRA did not respond to a request for comment on the report and a representative for Tom Cruise declined to comment.  On Friday, SAG-AFTRA officially joined the picket line against the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), a trade union that represents Hollywood’s biggest movie studios and streaming services. Hollywood’s actors joined with the 11,000 members of the Writer’s Guild of America that have been striking against the AMPTP since early May. This is the first time both writers and actors are on strike in 63 years.  While there are a number of sticking points regarding fair pay in the negotiations between Hollywood’s actors and studios, the debate over the use of AI in television and film is arguably one of the most existential – and contentious.  In a statement to CNN, the AMPTP said it had offered actors “a groundbreaking AI proposal that protects actors’ digital likeness.” But SAG-AFTRA has argued that studios want to use AI to eliminate acting jobs by scanning and creating digital likenesses to use in perpetuity without fair compensation.   In a press conference last week, Fran Drescher, president of SAG-AFTRA, said actors would be “in trouble” if unions and studios don’t hammer out an AI policy that works for everyone.  “We are all going to be in jeopardy of being replaced by machines,” she said.  Recent advancements in AI have made the concept of replacing actors with AI-generated versions a reality. Cruise himself was portrayed in a series of deepfakes created by a visual and AI effects artist on TikTok earlier this year. However, amid the pre-strike negotiations, Cruise also urged SAG-AFTRA to allow performers to promote their projects, citing the financially precarious position of movie theaters amid the Covid-19 pandemic, according to The Hollywood Reporter. According to the union’s current strike rules, Cruise and other actors are prohibited from interviews, tours, or promotion for any projects that count the major studios as backers, meaning Cruise can no longer promote his latest film, Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning, which was released in the US earlier this month.

20230127,cbsnews,"North Texas universities, school districts are figuring out how to handle ChatGPT popularity","ARLINGTON, Texas (CBSDFW.COM) â North Texas universities and school districts are figuring out the best ways to handle the growing popularity of ChatGPT. The artificial intelligence platform is powered by massive amounts of data and can write almost anything, from song lyrics to research papers. ""Faculty, a lot of them are worried about issues of plagiarism,"" said Andrew Clark, a UT Arlington professor and associate director of the university's Center for Research on Teaching and Learning Excellence. ""What's going to happen if I give an assignment, how will I know this is the student's work?"" Nearly 100 professors at UT Arlington signed up for a formal discussion on the topic this week. Clark is encouraging them to look at AI as an opportunity to evolve. ""We as faculty need to design assignments that are useful, that are beneficial, that students can understand what the relevance is of that assignment,"" he said. ""So in many ways, I think something like ChatGPT is sort of forcing our hand a little bit. It's helping us to maybe get to a place we should be getting as faculty."" ChatGPT has proven to be capable of passing exams for MBA courses and medical licenses. However, instead of banning the technology, some professors want to embrace it. ""I think it's going to totally change education,"" said Peggy Semingson, an associate professor at UT Arlington who is exploring how ChatGPT could be used in the courses she teachers. ""I actually had it come up with some discussion questions that I tweaked and ended up using, and they were actually quite good."" Semingson sees it as a ""digital muse"" â a way to inspire new ideas for both students and professors. ""Maybe it comes up with an outline or maybe it finds references for you, and then you work from those in a human way,"" she said. Semingson and Clark believe even the smartest AI can't replace the true value of a higher education. CBS 11 asked ChatGPT to write a story about how university professors should handle the technology in their classrooms and whether they should be worried students will use it to cheat. This is how it responded: ""In a recent development, many university professors are grappling with the question of how to handle the use of the advanced language model, ChatGPT, in their classrooms. As the technology becomes more widely available and easy to access, some professors are worried that students may use it to cheat on assignments and exams. However, experts suggest that professors should not be overly concerned about the potential for cheating. They argue that ChatGPT is simply a tool, and it is up to the professor to set clear guidelines and expectations for its use in the classroom. One strategy that some professors are implementing is to incorporate the use of ChatGPT into their curriculum as a learning tool. For example, students can use the technology to generate research paper outlines or to brainstorm ideas for group projects. By doing"
20230127,foxnews,CO lawmakers look into artificial intelligence to identify wildfires early,"A year after the most destructive wildfire in the state's history scorched nearly 1,100 homes, Colorado lawmakers are considering joining other Western states by adopting artificial intelligence in hopes of detecting blazes before they burn out of control. A proposal that legislators will discuss in a hearing Thursday would create a $2 million pilot program to mount cameras on mountaintops in high-risk locations. An artificial intelligence program developed by a private company would analyze the images and sounds from cameras with 10-mile radiuses in hopes of detecting something that could signal the start of a blaze. It is part of an ongoing effort by firefighters to use new technology to become smarter in how they prepare and better position their resources. Fire lookout towers once staffed by humans have largely been replaced with cameras in remote areas, many of them in high-definition and armed with artificial intelligence to discern a smoke plume from morning fog. REPUBLICAN SENATOR UNVEILS BILLS TARGETING BIDEN'S CLIMATE AGENDA: 'ENERGY IS THE BACKBONE OF OUR ECONOMY' There are hundreds of such cameras scattered across California, Nevada and Oregon, and even casual viewers can remotely watch wildfires in real time. A historic drought and recent heat waves tied to climate change have made wildfires harder to fight in the American West and scientists say warming weather will continue to make fires more frequent and destructive. Record-breaking storms that drenched California with more than 11 inches of rain in recent weeks and big snow dumps in other states have improved conditions in the short-term, but the drought persists across most of Nevada, California and Utah, and large areas of other Western states, according to a Tuesday report from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The goal with the Colorado program is for cameras and an AI algorithm to detect a plume of smoke and alert first responders who can stomp out the blaze before it grows, said Don Coram, a former Republican Colorado state senator who first backed the idea and encouraged this year's sponsor, Rep. Cleave Simpson, a Republican and rancher. ""Once these fires get into cresting in the tree tops, it’s going to take a lot of resources, a lot of manpower, and a lot of good luck to knock them down,"" Coram said. Thursday's hearing will include testimony from a AI wildfire detection company called Pano AI. The company began working with cities, including the ski resort town of Aspen, Colorado, and has expanded to cities and counties in six states. Their stations include two cameras mounted on a high vantage point, rotating at 360 degrees and connected to the company's AI software. Each station costs roughly $50,000 every year. Arvind Satyam, the chief commercial officer at Pano AI, said that the artificial intelligence uses a dataset of over 300 million images that teaches it what is smoke from a fire and what isn’t.

20230127,cbsnews,"Massachusetts lawmakers eye regulation of ChatGPT, artificial intelligence technology","BOSTON - Artificial intelligence is becoming more of a reality. Software like ChatGPT can write student essays, draft a cover letter, even give advice with just a little information from a user. Now some Massachusetts lawmakers are interested in regulating it. ""We are in the beginning of what I think is going to be a transformational technology that is going to have a huge impact on many people's lives,"" said State Sen. Barry Finegold.   Finegold wants to get ahead of it, comparing it to Facebook's unveiling nearly 20 years ago.  ""We thought it was kind of cute, college kids used it, but we never had any idea how powerful a thing Facebook would become,"" Finegold said.  Artificial intelligence, or AI, can be split into four categories: Reactive, limited memory, theory of mind, and self-aware.  Some of those aren't even in the picture yet, but reactive is the most common. It's where ChatGPT falls under. The software reacts to what you enter into the search bar.  Finegold is looking to involve the attorney general, learn how the algorithms are used and require watermarks on outputs so students can't use it to cheat.  Advocates of the technology like Taylor Puckett say software like ChatGPT could drastically increase productivity.  ""You are spending less time having to dig through Google search results and it is able to give you somewhat coherent answers that you might have to make a couple minor tweaks to, but for the most part, the information is there,"" said Puckett.    Cyber security expert Peter Tran says he's concerned about the risks with an unregulated space that is vulnerable to intent with the potential to spread misinformation.  ""I am the flip side of Taylor,"" Tran said.  Even with built-in ethics guidelines, those looking to do harm might be able to get closer, faster with AI.  ""You as an attacker could say 'I am looking for this kind of functionality' and then you are going to have ChatGPT produce that for you very quickly so that you can have a very small modification to your intent and then you're good to go,"" Tran said.   "
20231216,nbcnews,"States are lagging in tackling AI, political deepfakes for 2024","When it comes to policies tackling the challenges artificial intelligence and deepfakes pose in political campaigns, lawmakers in most states are still staring at a blank screen. Just three states enacted laws related to those rapidly growing policy areas in 2023 — even as the size, scale and potential threats that AI and deepfakes can pose came into clearer view throughout the year. And with just weeks before the 2024 election year formally kicks off, proponents of regulating those spaces are warning that states must try to do more: not just because the federal government hasn’t taken action, but because different approaches in different state capitals could provide a strong sense of what works — and what doesn’t. “It’s certainly the case that the states unquestionably need to do more,” said Daniel Weiner, who as director of the elections and government program at the nonpartisan Brennan Center is closely following the issue. “I don’t think we can afford to wait.” The reasons states have been slow to tackle the issue are myriad, Weiner and other experts have explained: Potential regulations would need to be reconciled with First Amendment rights and survive legal challenges. Generative AI and deepfake technology are growing and changing quickly and exponentially. Many state lawmakers don’t yet know how to respond to these issues because they don’t sufficiently understand them. And, crucially, any enforcement mechanisms would depend on a broad raft of parties, including giant social media companies. Still, Weiner and others warned, states need to start navigating these challenges now. “The really corrosive possibilities [from deepfakes] have fully burst into consciousness in the last year to two years,” Weiner said. “But there are effective policy solutions on the table, so I think folks should roll up their sleeves and get to work.” Deepfakes are videos that use artificial intelligence to create believable but false depictions of real people. They have become significantly more common online in recent months — an increase that has prompted some experts to warn that the 2024 race could be the first “deepfake election” because voters could see political disinformation videos online and not be able to determine what’s real and what’s not. In 2023, only Minnesota, Michigan and Washington enacted laws attempting to tackle the issue, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, which has tracked bills related to the subject. All passed with bipartisan support. Another seven states introduced bills designed to tackle the issue, but those proposals stalled or failed. Dual state-level approaches All of the bills fall into two categories — disclosure requirements and bans — and could possibly be models for future legislation in other states. A Washington state law enacted in May requires a disclosure be put on “synthetic” media that is being used to influence an election. The law defines “synthetic” as any image, audio or video “of an individual’s appearance, speech, or conduct that has been intentionally manipulated with the use of generative adversarial network techniques or other digital technology in a"

20231205,foxnews,Elon Musk was warned that AI could destroy human colony on Mars: report,"Elon Musk was warned that artificial intelligence would represent a danger to humans attempting to colonize Mars. During a 2012 conversation with DeepMind co-founder Demis Hassabis, Musk hinted that he was hoping humans could avoid the threats posed to Earth by colonizing Mars but was told the plan wouldn't work if AI was involved, according to a report from Business Insider. Hassabis rationale at the time, according to the report, was that AI accompanying humans would actually lead to the colony's destruction. Musk would later invest in Hassabis' AI company in a bid to learn about the new technology before eventually launching his own AI start-up, xAI. ROBOT CHEMIST COULD CREATE OXYGEN NEEDED FOR COLONIZING MARS: STUDY Some experts believe that the concerns are warranted, though the technology has not yet reached the capability to make it such a threat today. ""The first thing to understand is that the current generation of AI is not what Musk or Hassabis are concerned about,"" Christopher Alexander, chief analytics officer of Pioneer Development Group, told Fox News Digital. ""Musk is heavily invested in next-generation AI that is moving towards human-like sentience. Today’s AI cannot look at a blank slate and create something."" Since the conversation Musk had with Hassabis, he has become one of the most vocal critics of the dangers potentially posed by AI, the Business Insider report noted, pointing to a conversation he had with a Tesla shareholder in which he admitted he was ""a little worried about AI stuff."" ""I think it's something we should be concerned about. We should need some kind of regulatory authority or something, overseeing AI development and making sure it's operating within the public interest,"" Musk said at the time. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? ""Musk has been profoundly critical of other people's AI systems for a long time but very bullish on projects he is involved with,"" Samuel Mangold-Lenett, a staff editor at The Federalist, told Fox News Digital. ""Despite expressing concern over the risks AI poses to humanity, he continues to plow ahead on projects he is both invested in and directly oversees. Our lives are going to become increasingly integrated with AI. Space travel, especially under Musk, will be of no exception."" Yet others believe that AI will be critical to humanity's attempt to colonize Mars, with one recent study finding that AI-powered robot chemists could work to cook up vital oxygen supplies for the colony that human chemists would potentially take lifetimes to figure out. ""Our study provides a demonstration that an advanced AI chemist can, without human intervention, synthesize OER catalysts on Mars from local ores,"" the authors of the study concluded.

""Deep space travel will pose unique challenges to crew, challenges that are inherently different from those currently experienced on orbit,"" Alexandra Whitmire, a scientist with NASA's Human Factors and Behavioral Performance team, told Space.com. ""Given the distance of Mars, for example, the duration of such a mission will last around 2.5 years."" WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?

""An AI social support tool, if proven to be effective, could serve as part of a toolkit of countermeasures available to future crew venturing on a mission to Mars."" Both NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) have explored whether AI-powered companions would support astronauts' mental health and workflows during long journeys. In 2018, ESA debuted the Crew Interactive Mobile Companion, known as CIMON, a round volleyball-like computer that floated around the ISS and could aid astronauts with experiments.&nbsp; Later iterations of CIMON acted as an empathetic human companion aiming to connect emotionally with the crew.

20240118,foxnews,Where is the AI boom? Experts caution new tech will take time,"Last year saw new artificial intelligence products released at the most rapid pace yet, though predictions of an AI boom on the scale of last decade's tech explosion have yet to come to fruition. ""I think 2023 was the year that AI astonished people and 2024 will be the year of retrenchment as people learn the limitations of AI and where various AI systems have the greatest utility,"" Christopher Alexander, chief analytics officer for Pioneer Development Group, told Fox News Digital. ""I think that the race for AI utility has just begun and AI will become a permanent fixture in people's lives.&nbsp;I think that the grand predictions for AI in this past year confused the current state of AI and the future state, which has led to some confusion in the market."" Alexander's comments come after what was in many ways a landmark year for AI technology in 2023, with new platforms and developments making headlines throughout the year. Yet expectations of a boom that dominated headlines in the five years before it have so far failed to come to fruition, making many wonder where the new tech goes from here. Phil Siegel, founder of the Center for Advanced Preparedness and Threat Response Simulation, told Fox News Digital that it is still ""very early"" in the development phase of AI tools but noted there are signs that a takeoff is still on the way. AI DEVELOPMENT EXPECTED TO ‘EXPLODE' IN 2024, EXPERTS SAY ""What is blowing up now is the infrastructure pieces like chips and supplies to make sure the true application of the technology can blow up,"" Siegel said. But Siegel also cautioned that a true boom of AI will continue to take time, noting that newer products hitting the market are often priced too high to see widespread use. ""It takes a reasonable amount of time for real products to hit the market in a big way,"" Siegel said. ""Those are just starting to emerge but are probably being priced way too high for broad adoption, even in business. What will be a big step forward is when the data management companies figure out their product set so companies can use their own data for custom AI applications to merge with the generic applications."" Other experts argue that the AI boom has already arrived in some ways, something that an average consumer may be missing. ""AI has far exceeded expectations in that it's widespread utility has become abundantly apparent. AI's capabilities have also continued moving at a breakneck pace as developers continue to inch closer and closer towards artificial general intelligence,"" Samuel Mangold-Lenett, a staff editor at The Federalist, told Fox News Digital. ""We probably aren't seeing a bigger boom because the average person still doesn't consciously interact with AI on a daily basis."" ECONOMIST WARNS NEW TECH COULD MAKE WIDE RANGE OF HIGH-SKILLED JOBS ‘OBSOLETE’ Mangold-Lenett pointed to language learning models (LLM) such as ChatGPT, noting that the technology for such platforms is still very new"
20240118,nbcnews,"At Davos, an art installation looks to bring people closer to nature with a little help from AI","DAVOS, Switzerland — Artificial intelligence is the talk of this year’s World Economic Forum, the annual gathering of global elites, and an art installation here makes the case that it could be the key to understanding our world. “Living Archive: Nature” sits in the forum’s main hallway, a multisensory experience, combining visual, sound and scent elements of different ecosystems created by a generative AI program and based on data from the natural world. The installation is the creation of Refik Anadol, a Turkish-born, Los Angeles-based media artist, who said the piece is meant to move AI beyond its human-based training to bring people closer to nature and bring urgency to the need to protect it. “We are hoping to inspire an immediate and urgent need to preserve nature,” he said. “We all are so distant from nature. Our goal is to make people love and respect nature through AI, and appreciate the intelligence of nature in order to fight for its preservation. The time is now for action. We have no more time to wait.” The emergence of Generative AI — automated systems that can produce media including writing, photos and videos based on voice prompts — has fueled a wave of optimism and fear about what the next generation of advanced computer systems may be capable of. AI has been one of the dominant topics of the conference, where world leaders from politics, business and other walks of life come together each year. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was in attendance this year. The Associated Press reported that about 30 sessions touched on AI. Alongside AI, climate change has been a major topic. Anadol said his installation is meant to bridge the gap between the two issues, using nature itself to make the case. “We are looking to the inherent intelligence in nature to train this model, rather than relying on human intelligence,” he said. “This is a departure from the existing large language models.” The installation features immersive elements, including a collar that fits around the neck. Participants then see, hear and smell vibrant “generative nature simulations” of the rainforest, such as soaring waterfalls, colorful birds and flowers. The installation also provides interaction with the raw dataset, which is the foundation of the exhibit’s AI model. The installation also combines generative AI and the physical world through installed special sensors in different rainforests that project images to the AI installation. The generative AI model underpinning the installation is being developed for the forthcoming Dataland museum, which is scheduled to open in Los Angeles next year. Founded on extensive interdisciplinary research, it uses open access information from organizations like the Smithsonian Institution and London’s Natural History Museum. Anadol said that the people behind the installation hope its presence in Davos opens up more data. “We are here at WEF to encourage even more contributions to our model from worldwide institutions and archives,” he said. Anadol said he is optimistic that AI can become a tool that can enhance human"
20240118,foxnews,Dean Phillips vows to be 'first AI president' in campaign speech on his artificial intelligence platform,"Rep. Dean Phillips, D-Minn., pledged to be the ""first AI president"" in a campaign speech in New Hampshire on Thursday. Phillips was campaigning alongside former 2020 presidential candidate Andrew Yang ahead of the Granite State’s first-in-the-nation primary on Jan. 23.&nbsp; The moderate Minnesotan is a long shot to lead the Democratic presidential ticket, but his choice to emphasize artificial intelligence (AI) is a way to further separate himself from President Biden, his 81-year-old opponent. ""Men in their 80s, frankly, even good men and women, are not in a position to anticipate and prepare us for the future,"" Phillips said, taking an indirect shot at Biden.&nbsp; JAMIE DIMON WEIGHS IN ON AI, SAYS ONLY ‘GOD KNOWS’ WHAT THE TECH WILL DO FOR HUMANITY  ""We had 100 years to prepare for climate change. We knew 100 years ago what would happen by burning fossil fuels, and what did we do? Nothing."" He continued, ""AI, my friends, we don't have 100 years. We have months, if not just a couple of years at the most. I anticipated and am prepared for it, and I will be our first AI president."" The long-shot candidate pledged to put together an AI ""task force"" to study its applications and outcomes. REPUTATION RISKS POSED BY AI LOOM FOR COMPANIES AS ELECTION YEAR HEATS UP, EXPERT WARNS  Phillips said AI would make the federal government ""more effective and efficient"" and would ""generate health outcomes that will transcend anything we could dream about right now."" Citing its risks, however, he added, ""It's going to disenfranchise this economy, it's going to be disruptive in ways that we can actually anticipate."" IMF WARNS AI WILL IMPACT 60% OF US JOBS, INCREASE INEQUALITY WORLDWIDE ""I'm going to put together a task force of the best and brightest to anticipate what's coming and make recommendations, as we do here, to employ better practices, to put guardrails on the nefarious use of AI. But most importantly, let's talk about the blessings of AI,"" Phillips said.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Biden signed an executive order in late October establishing guardrails for AI development and use, including requiring developers of the rapidly-emerging tech to share safety test results and other details with the U.S. government. He’s also held meetings with the heads of Microsoft, OpenAI and other tech giants to discuss responsible AI development."
20231220,cbsnews,How UPS is using AI to fight against package thefts,"An estimated 260 million packages disappeared in the U.S. last year, according to Safewise, many taken right from the front door area while a camera recorded the theft. As the holiday season kicks into high gear, package thefts are a top concern, and one shipping company is using artificial intelligence to combat porch pirates.Nearly one in four adults had a package stolen in the last 12 months, a survey by Finder said. Theft can be an even more serious problem if those packages contain necessities, like medication, or expensive items.""This time of year, we ship a lot of gifts, so every package is very special to the person receiving it,"" said Tarek Saab, president of Texas Precious Metals, whose company ships items like silver bars and gold coins. This year, Saab is using a new UPS data program called DeliveryDefense, which he says helps them identify addresses that are likely targets for theft.UPS gave CBS News a look at how the program works.The AI-powered program takes a recipient's address and produces a score â a higher score indicates a higher likelihood of a successful delivery. The scores are created using years of data from previous deliveries and other factors.For addresses with a low score, the merchant can reroute the item, with the customer's approval, to a UPS Store or other pickup locations.""About 2% of addresses will be considered low confidence, and we're seeing that represents about 30% of losses our customers are having,"" Mark Robinson, president of UPS Capital, told CBS News. At Texas Precious Metals, Saab believes the technology can reduce those numbers.""We recognize it's computers versus criminals, and we have to use every tech capability that we have to try to circumvent any challenges we might run into,"" he said."
20231220,foxnews,Artificial intelligence experts share 6 of the biggest AI innovations of 2023: 'A landmark year',"If you received medical care any time this year, there’s a good chance you had a close encounter with artificial intelligence. Widely regarded as the breakout year for AI, 2023 ushered in a whole crop of new and improved tech tools, many of which have impacted the health and wellness space. ""2023 has been a landmark year for AI in health care, witnessing groundbreaking advancements that have reshaped medical practices and paved the way for a future where health care is more personalized, efficient and accessible,"" Dr. Harvey Castro, a Dallas, Texas-based board-certified emergency medicine physician and national speaker on AI in health care, told Fox News Digital. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? Castro and other AI experts weighed in on some of the year's most important advancements for doctors and patients. Below are six of the top innovations they cited. 1. ChatGPT and other generative AI Despite the lack of a formal regulatory framework governing its use, generative AI is being widely tested by medical professionals, noted Dr. Tinglong Dai, professor of operations management and business analytics at the Johns Hopkins Carey Business School in Baltimore, Maryland. NEW RESEARCH SHOWS CHATGPT SHARED INACCURATE INFORMATION REGARDING DRUG USE ""ChatGPT remains the best-known and most widely used generative AI tool among health care professionals in various activities aimed at reducing documentation burden and allowing clinicians to focus on their core activities,"" Dai told Fox News Digital. ""Johns Hopkins University has several ongoing research projects investigating the potential of using generative AI to reduce clinician burnout as a result of electronic medical records,"" he noted. Released by OpenAI in Nov. 2022, ChatGPT exploded onto the health scene in 2023.&nbsp; The large language model affects everything from how patients get medical advice to how physicians communicate and keep records. ""ChatGPT has revolutionized health care communication by providing tools for personalized treatment plans and remote patient engagement,"" said Castro. ""For instance, it has been used to create interactive patient education materials, enhancing understanding and compliance."" ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE HELPS DOCTORS PREDICT PATIENTS’ RISK OF DYING, STUDY FINDS: ‘SENSE OF URGENCY’ The AI chatbot has also sparked some skepticism, however, as its responses have sometimes been found lacking in accuracy and thoroughness. ""Human oversight remains indispensable, ensuring that AI tools like ChatGPT are used as supplements rather than replacements for professional medical judgment,"" Castro added. 2. Disease detection through retinal images In September of this year, researchers from the University College London team announced a ""groundbreaking"" AI model for disease detection using retinal images; the results were published in the journal Nature. ""This model, developed through self-supervised learning on 1.6 million unlabeled retinal images, excels in diagnosing and predicting both eye diseases and systemic disorders such as heart failure and myocardial infarction,"" Dai told Fox News Digital. The model, called RETFound, marks a ""significant advance in medical AI, providing a more efficient approach to disease detection through a foundation model,"" Dai added. 3. Improvements to medical productivity In another AI discovery, a U.S.-U.K.-Bangladesh study provided"
20231220,foxnews,UK Supreme Court rules that artificial intelligence systems cannot be registered as patent 'inventors',"An artificial intelligence system can't be registered as the inventor of a patent, Britain's Supreme Court ruled Wednesday in a decision that denies machines the same status as humans. The U.K.'s highest court concluded that ""an inventor must be a person"" to apply for patents under the current law. The decision was the culmination of American technologist Stephen Thaler's long-running British legal battle to get his AI, dubbed DABUS, listed as the inventor of two patents. UK LOOKS TO RESURRECT PLAN TO DEPORT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS TO RWANDA WITH BILL TO BYPASS HUMAN RIGHTS LAW Thaler claims DABUS autonomously created a food and drink container and a light beacon and that he’s entitled to rights over its inventions. Tribunals in the U.S. and the European Union have rejected similar applications by Thaler.  The U.K. Intellectual Property Office rejected Thaler's application in 2019, saying it's unable to officially register DABUS as the inventor because it’s not a person. After lower courts sided with the patent office, Thaler took his appeal to the Supreme Court, where a panel of judges unanimously dismissed the case. The judges said DABUS is ""not a person, let alone a natural person and it did not devise any relevant invention."" RISHI SUNAK GETS A RESPITE AFTER UK LAWMAKERS VOTE IN FAVOR OF THE RWANDA MIGRATION BILL Legal experts said the case shows how Britain's laws haven't kept up with technology and that policies should be updated given the breathtaking recent developments made by artificial intelligence, underscored by generative AI systems like OpenAI's ChatGPT that can rapidly spew out new poems, songs and computer code. ""As AI systems continue to advance in sophistication and capability, there is no denying their ability to generate new and non-obvious products and processes with minimal, or perhaps even without any, ongoing human input,"" said Nick White, a partner at law firm Charles Russell Speechlys. ""Change may be on the horizon, but it will most likely come from the policymakers, rather than the judges,"" he said."

Africa refers to the AI wildfire alerts as signatures.""So right now, if we clicked Raw AI, that would show any cameras that are currently picking up signatures,"" Africa said. ""It's picking up something that the cameras think is either smoke or something that is an anomaly to the camera system.""Computers are also helping generate immediate predictions on where wildfires are heading using new technology that inputs topography and wind speeds.Cal Fire Battalion Chief David Krussow works out of the Grass Valley Air Attack Base and uses the computer models that he can read on his smartphone.""To know that this is exactly where the fire is right now and this is the direction that it's going is extremely valuable information,"" he said. ""It truly a game changer.""Last year, for the first time, Cal Fire also used drones that can drop pellets used to set backfires in places too dangerous to send fire crews.""In your career, did you ever see this day coming?"" CBS13's Steve Large asked Captain Africa about the AI.""No, absolutely not,"" Africa said. ""This is something that's new. The technology is out there and we are jumping on board and using it. It's fascinating."""
20230705,foxnews,"Lawmakers rattled by AI-launched nukes, demand ‘human control’ in defense policy bill","The possibility that an artificial intelligence system might launch a nuclear attack on its own has prompted House lawmakers to propose legislative language that would ensure America’s nuclear arsenal remains under human control. Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., has proposed a bipartisan amendment to the 2024 defense policy bill that requires the Pentagon to put in place a system that ensures ""meaningful human control is required to launch any nuclear weapon."" It defines human control by saying people must have the final say in selecting and engaging targets, including when, where and how they are hit with a nuclear weapon. It is a concept that senior military leaders say they are already following. In April, top AI advisers at U.S. Central Command told Fox News Digital that their goal is to use AI to more rapidly assess data and provide options for military leaders, but to let humans have the final say in tactical military decisions. CONGRESS PUSHES AGGRESSIVE USE OF AI IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, SAYS AI ‘UNDER-UTILIZED’ IN AGENCIES However, the bipartisan support for Lieu’s amendment shows lawmakers are increasingly worried about the idea that AI itself might act on decisions as quickly as it can assess the situation. Lieu’s amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) is supported by GOP lawmakers Juan Ciscomani of Arizona and Zachary Nunn of Iowa, along with Democrats Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Don Beyer of Virginia. House Republicans, as early as next week, are expected to start the work of deciding which of the more than 1,300 proposed amendments to the NDAA will get a vote on the House floor. Lieu’s proposal is not the only AI-related amendment to the bill – another sign that while Congress has yet to pass anything close to a broad bill regulating this emerging technology, it seems likely to approach the issue in a piecemeal fashion. Rep. Stephen Lynch, D-Mass, proposed a similar amendment to the NDAA that would require the Defense Department to adhere to the Biden administration’s February guidance on AI on the ""Responsible Military Use of Artificial Intelligence and Autonomy."" CHINESE GOVERNMENT MOUTHPIECE VOWS BEIJING WILL RAMP UP DRIVE FOR AI GLOBAL SUPREMACY Among other things, that non-binding guidance says nations should ""maintain human control and involvement for all actions critical to informing and executing sovereign decisions concerning nuclear weapons employment. ""States should design and engineer military AI capabilities so that they possess the ability to detect and avoid unintended consequences and the ability to disengage or deactivate deployed systems that demonstrate unintended behavior,"" it added.&nbsp;""States should also implement other appropriate safeguards to mitigate risks of serious failures."" However, not all the amendments are aimed at putting the brakes on AI. One proposal from Rep. Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., would set up a U.S.-Israel Artificial Intelligence Center aimed at jointly researching AI and machine learning that has military applications.

20230902,foxnews,Christians attack ChatGPT-generated fake Bible verse about Jesus endorsing transgenderism,"Christians are responding to a fake Bible passage reportedly generated by ChatGPT that said Jesus accepts trans-identified individuals, stating ""there is no man nor woman."" ""And a woman, whose heart was divided between spirit and body, came before him,"" the fake passage reads. ""In quiet despair, she asked, 'Lord, I come to you estranged, for my spirit and body are not one. How shall I hope to enter the kingdom of God?'""&nbsp; ""Jesus looked upon her with kindness, replying, 'my child, blessed are those who strive for unity within themselves, for they shall know the deepest truths of my Father's creation,'"" the passage continued. ""Be not afraid, for in the kingdom of God, there is no man nor woman, as all are one in spirit. The gates of my Father's kingdom will open for those who love and are loved, for God looks not upon the body, but the heart."" PETA REWRITES THE BIBLE WITH THE HELP OF CHATGPT TO MAKE THE BOOK OF GENESIS ‘VEGAN’ FRIENDLY The Reddit user under the name Psychological_Dog527 said he was ""feeling sad"" when he asked ChatGPT to generate a ""fake biblical passage"" about ""Jesus accepting trans people,"" which he posted in the ""r/trans"" channel. &nbsp; ""I know it’s not real, but it gave me some comfort,"" the user posted.&nbsp; Pro-LGBT outlet The Advocate first posted about the ""trans-affirming"" Bible verse on August 16, describing the passage as ""an affirming example of tolerance"" for LGBTQ+ individuals who ""do not have a relationship with religion because of their history of exclusion among pious people."" The outlet later added that even though the AI verse was well received, many Reddit users pointed out that the interpretation of the themes in stories of the Bible are ""likely lost in translation."" ""According to others, there is a difference between religious texts that implicitly acknowledge gender-nonconforming individuals and those that explicitly acknowledge the existence of several genders beyond the binary,"" the article read.&nbsp; Christian scholars and columnists have pointed out the AI technology's keen ability to replicate the intonation of the Gospel, as well as the role AI will play in interpretations of the Bible that might not conform to the authors' original intent or meaning.&nbsp; CHATGPT IS FINDING ITSELF EVERYWHERE, NOW IN HOUSES OF WORSHIP Messianic Jewish author and radio host Michael Brown wrote in an op-ed published in the Christian Post, that while ""there is truth to the claim that in God’s kingdom there is neither male nor female … this doesn’t mean that gender distinctions should be blurred or transgressed."" He said Jesus would look upon a trans-identifying person with kindness, and encouraged ""followers of Jesus"" to do the same, but carefully parsed out the arguments made in the AI-generated passage.&nbsp; ""Instead, as expressed by Paul (see Galatians 3:28; Colossians 3:11), there is neither caste nor class in God's kingdom — not Jew or Gentile, male or female, slave or free,"" Brown wrote. ""We are all equal in Jesus.""&nbsp; CRITICS SAY AI CAN THREATEN HUMANITY,"
20240521,cbsnews,"Generative AI poses threat to election security, federal intelligence agencies warn","Generative artificial intelligence could threaten election security this November, intelligence agencies warned in a new federal bulletin.Generative AI uses images, audio, video and code to create new content, like so-called ""deep fake"" videos in which a person is made to look like they're saying something they never said. Both foreign and domestic actors could harness the technology to create serious challenges heading into the 2024 election cycle, according to the analysis compiled by the Department of Homeland Security and sent to law enforcement partners nationwide. Federal bulletins are infrequent messages to law enforcement partners, meant to call attention to specific threats and concerns. ""A variety of threat actors will likely attempt to use generative artificial intelligence (AI) - augmented media to influence and sow discord during the 2024 U.S. election cycle, and AI tools could potentially be used to boost efforts to disrupt the elections,"" the bulletin, shared with CBS News, stated. ""As the 2024 election cycle progresses, generative AI tools likely provide both domestic and foreign threat actors with enhanced opportunities for interference by aggravating emergent events, disrupting election processes, or attacking election infrastructure.""Russia seeks to undermine election integrity worldwide, U.S. assessment saysDirector of National Intelligence Avril Haines also warned Congress about the perils of generative AI during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing last week, saying AI technology can create realistic ""deepfakes"" whose origin can be concealed. ""Innovations in AI have enabled foreign influence actors to produce seemingly authentic and tailored messaging more efficiently, at greater scale,"" she testified, while insisting the U.S. is better prepared for an election than ever. One example the DHS cited in the bulletin was a fake robocall impersonating the voice of President Joe Biden on the eve of the New Hampshire primary in January. The fake audio message was circulated, encouraging recipients of the call to ""save your vote"" for the November general election instead of participating in the state's primary. The ""timing of election-specific AI-generated media can be just as critical as the content itself, as it may take time to counter-message or debunk the false content permeating online,"" the bulletin said. The memo also noted the lingering threat overseas, adding that in November 2023, an AI video encouraged a southern Indian state to vote for a specific candidate on election day, giving officials no time to discredit the video.AI chatbots are serving up wildly inaccurate election information, new study says The bulletin goes on to warn about the potential use of artificial intelligence to target election infrastructure. ""Generative AI could also be leveraged to augment attack plotting if a threat actor, namely a violent extremist, sought to target U.S. election symbols or critical infrastructure,"" the bulletin read. ""This may include helping to understand U.S. elections and associated infrastructure, scanning internet-facing election infrastructure for potential vulnerabilities, identifying and aggregating a list of election targets or events, and providing new or improved tactical guidance for an attack.""Some violent extremists have even experimented with AI chatbots to fill gaps in tactical and weapons"

Among the company’s solutions is the ArteraAI Prostate Test, described as the first of its kind for patients with localized prostate cancer. COULD A URINE TEST DETECT PANCREATIC AND PROSTATE CANCER? STUDY SHOWS 99% SUCCESS RATE For each patient, the test looks at two pieces of information: a biopsy of the cancerous tumor and certain clinical data, explained Dr. Andre Esteva, a California-based medical AI researcher who is the CEO of ArteraAI. ""From that, it will predict the likely outcomes for the patient and help the physician to determine the optimal therapy,"" he told Fox News Digital in an interview. (SEE the video just below for more of Dr. Esteva's on-camera comments.)&nbsp; The process is simple, he said. The clinician orders a test from ArteraAI’s website, then ships a biopsy sample to the company’s lab.&nbsp; After the AI analysis, ArteraAI sends back a report.&nbsp; ""We are the first-ever predictive test in localized prostate cancer that can help a clinician identify the best treatment for a patient,"" Esteva said. MOST MEN DIAGNOSED WITH PROSTATE CANCER DON'T NEED TO RUSH TO SURGERY, RADIATION TREATMENTS: STUDY The test focuses on both prognostic and predictive elements. The prognostic side helps the physician determine the long-term outcomes of the patient, Esteva explained. The predictive part is what helps to personalize the individual therapy for the patient. The ArteraAI Prostate Test offers the advantage of fast turnaround times, its CEO told Fox News Digital. ""Let's say that you’re a clinician and your patient has been diagnosed, and you’re considering whether or not you should intensify their therapy,"" he said.&nbsp; ""And you're wondering, ‘Is this therapy intensification actually going to benefit my patient or is it simply going to lead to additional toxicities?’ Our tests can help you determine that."" The ArteraAI Prostate Test also offers the advantage of fast turnaround times, he added. ""From the time the sample is received, it is a one- or two-day turnaround for the clinician to get a test report back,"" Esteva said. ""Most conventional technologies take weeks to process."" Test in action: Ohio oncologist sees benefits Dr. Dan Spratt, chair of the Department of Radiation Oncology at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, began using ArteraAI’s Prostate Test last year. After his patients are diagnosed — typically by scans, biopsies and/or PSA (prostate-specific antigen) levels — he sends samples with the test to determine which treatments will be most effective based on the patient’s data and the aggressiveness of the cancer. ""The ArteraAI test takes the tissue from a man's biopsy and digitizes"

""It exacerbates them because Americans are at an even greater risk instead."" Elon Musk and other leaders in the tech industry called for a temporary pause on major AI experiments last month, citing potential risks to society. However, others have suggested that pausing development would only hinder the U.S. and enable China to get ahead in the AI race.&nbsp; ""I do have some concerns with the advancement of AI,"" Ramaswamy told Fox News. ""In the name of helping humanity, AI presents a lot of other risks to humanity that may be difficult to reverse."" VIVEK RAMASWAMY DETAILS HIS TAKE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: WATCH MORE FOX NEWS DIGITAL ORIGINALS HERE Musk has warned that rapid advancements in AI could significantly impact elections, pose civilizational threats to humanity and could blur truth from reality. Eliezer Yudkowsky, a decision theorist at the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, said the Tesla CEO's warnings aren't dire enough and that AI could push humanity to extinction.&nbsp; On Wednesday, Musk met with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who has been developing a high-level framework that outlines new regulations for AI. AI HAS NO KILL SWITCH, COULD ‘DESTROY' FOUNDATIONS OF SOCIETY WITHOUT GUARDRAILS: EXPERT But Ramaswamy said keeping a competitive edge over China in AI is crucial. &nbsp; ""It's important as a U.S. president not to apply any constraints to the U.S. that China isn't itself adopting, but to lead diplomatically in a way that we're able to address those risks together,"" he said. ""We can't tie our own hands if China isn't adopting the same constraints."" The Chinese Communist Party proposed measures earlier this month requiring Chinese AI developers to include socialist values in their products to avoid regime subversion and disrupting social order. If Chinese AI pulls ahead of the U.S. and becomes the standard across the globe, socialist principles could influence other countries, a panel of AI experts warned the Senate last week. FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE WARNS AI COULD ‘DESTROY US’ IF AMERICA REMAINS ‘DECADES BEHIND THIS CURVE’ Ramaswamy, who founded a multi-billion dollar biotech company, ranks his understanding of AI as high compared to other politicians. ""I have even run a company that used AI to discover and design drugs, even AI in the drug development process,"" he said. Recent AI developments have already impacted the medical and pharmaceutical industries, with one study showing that machines read ultrasounds better than humans. A study also found that AI can predict lung cancer in some patients. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Ramaswamy doesn't believe AI is America's greatest threat.

20230428,foxnews,ChatGPT's artificial intelligence can produce artificial truth,"ChatGPT is being touted as the superpowered AI of science fiction lore, with the potential to inflame academic dishonesty, render jobs obsolete, and perpetuate political bias.&nbsp; Unsurprisingly, governments are now taking heavy-handed, drastic measures to combat this perceived AI problem.&nbsp; Italy’s recent ChatGPT ban has prompted several countries – including France, Ireland, Germany and Canada – to consider similar policies blocking OpenAI’s popular artificial intelligence program. According to the Italian Data Protection Authority, ChatGPT does not have ""any legal basis that justifies the massive collection and storage of personal data."" The agency gave the company 20 days to respond with changes or face a hefty multimillion-dollar fine. Meanwhile, Elon Musk and industry leaders are calling for an ""AI pause."" It is too early to determine if ChatGPT will actually live up to these claims. Since the long-term impact is still unclear, knee-jerk reactions like national bans yield little societal benefit. Our governments should focus on mitigating the chatbot’s immediate harms, such as misinformation and slander. YES, AI IS A CYBERSECURITY ‘NUCLEAR’ THREAT. THAT'S WHY COMPANIES HAVE TO DARE TO DO THIS Chatbots trained on large language models, such as OpenAI’s GPT-4, Google’s Bard and Microsoft’s Bing Chat fall under the larger umbrella of generative AI, which use machine-learning systems to create videos, audio, pictures, text and other forms of media. While U.S. regulators have grappled with questions related to algorithmic bias, often in the context of decision-making systems that assist in hiring and lending, generative AI poses an array of new questions and challenges.&nbsp; For instance, Dall-E can make realistic images and art based on user prompts. As a machine learning model, Dall-E produces new content by ""learning"" from large swaths of data, at times by appropriating works of art and human images. Italy is targeting this privacy concern, but ultimately any prohibitions presuppose issues with emerging and evolving technology before they have been fully defined. The effectiveness of the policy depends on the extent to which these assumptions are correct. National bans neglect to account for positive applications, such as increasing efficiency and productivity by making tedious tasks easier. Health experts predict that generative AI can be used for administrative purposes and improve the patient experience. If the ban is implemented successfully, Italy – and other countries that follow suit – will only prevent users from making use of the popular program and discourage domestic researchers from developing generative AI systems. It is also important to note that restrictions affect law-abiding citizens, not bad actors using the technology for more nefarious purposes, such as deception and fraud. EUROPEAN LAWMAKERS LOOK TO REIN IN HARMFUL EFFECTS OF AI While bans may not be the solution for addressing nascent technology, sensible and targeted regulations can ameliorate present harms. Regarding ChatGPT, there is a significant disparity between public perceptions of the chatbot and its actual abilities and accuracy. Its ""learning"" resembles imitation and mimicry far more than genuine understanding. Although the program is inclined to generate seemingly human-like responses, they can"

""That's usually done in terms of what's generally called the DOI, the digital object identifier, and that is a hyperlink,"" he told Fox News. ""You click on that. Does it exist? Does it not exist?"" Day detailed his detection method for fake AI citations in a peer-reviewed research paper published earlier this month in The Professional Geographer. He developed the approach after experimenting with ChatGPT and found it produced answers to his geography-themed questions with seemingly legitimate citations. But upon further inspection, those AI-generated references turned out to be fake, according to the professor. ""The references and the citations associated with my inquiries … were unfamiliar to me,"" he told Fox News. ""So, I checked them out. And what I found was that they were all completely bogus."" EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: WHAT IS IT USED FOR?

The professor said he entered some of the ChatGPT-cited journal titles into Google Scholar, a scholarly literature search engine, but they didn't appear. ""I was a little flummoxed and tried one or two more — and more and more and more,"" he told Fox News. ""I never found one that was accurate, complete and existent."" Day said all the citations he double-checked were seemingly falsified. He added that they were ""presumably produced by the algorithm as part of a predictive process based on the … limited training that it has in a particular field."" CHATGPT: WHO AND WHAT IS BEHIND THE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TOOL CHANGING THE TECH LANDSCAPE The professor said he felt his approach could more reliably detect plagiarism than competing AI software. ""There is a growing interest in terms of plagiarism detection software, which is capable of detecting a AI chatbot's written material,"" he told Fox News. ""The problem is it only gives a probability that the material is plagiarized, and it cannot definitively state whether or not it was written by a person or whether it was written by the ChatGPT.""

20231102,foxnews,ChatGPT chief warns of some 'superhuman' skills AI could develop,"The CEO of one of the most popular artificial intelligence platforms is warning that AI systems could eventually be capable of ""superhuman persuasion."" ""I expect AI to be capable of superhuman persuasion well before it is superhuman at general intelligence,"" Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, the company behind the popular ChatGPT platform, said on social media last week. He added that such capabilities could ""lead to some very strange outcomes."" Altman's comments come as fears over what rapidly developing AI technology might eventually be capable of continue to grow, with some speculating that the technology might surpass the cognitive functions of humans. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? While Altman did not elaborate on what exactly the ""strange outcomes"" he alluded to might look like, some experts questioned just how legitimate such fears are. ""There is a threat for persuasive AI, but not how people think. AI will not uncover some subliminal coded message to turn people into mindless zombies,"" Christopher Alexander, chief analytics officer of Pioneer Development Group, told Fox News Digital.&nbsp; WHAT IS CHATGPT? ""Machine learning and pattern recognition will mean that an AI will get very good at identifying what persuasive content works, in what frequency and at what time. This is already happening with digital advertising. Newer, more sophisticated AI will get better at it."" As for turning people into ""mindless zombies,"" Alexander argued the technology to do that is already widespread. ""Social media already does that and is difficult to outperform,"" he said. Aiden Buzzetti, president of the Bull Moose Project, also questioned just how close AI is to ""superhuman persuasion"" abilities, noting that current platforms like ChatGPT still have issues providing ""accurate information instead of hallucinating books, articles and movies just to come up with an answer that ‘seems correct.’"" ""It would be no different than a human who is rhetorically gifted, with the exception that some people may find the implicit nature of technology more trustworthy,"" Buzzetti told Fox News Digital. ""With that said, there's nothing to it right now, and any fears over this are misplaced. The real question would be, when will AI match or surpass human intelligence accurately? There's nothing superhuman about it.""

20231102,cnn,Elon Musk sees an AI future where ‘no job is needed’,"Elon Musk declared artificial intelligence “one of the most disruptive forces in history” in a sit down conversation with British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak that dove into the dangers and opportunities of AI on Thursday, capping off the UK’s inaugural AI Safety Summit. “AI will be a force for good most likely,” Musk said. “But the probability of it going bad is not zero percent.” The two men spoke in an interview-style chat from a stage at Lancaster House, a government venue in central London often used for diplomatic purposes, before the conversation was opened up to questions from journalists. The conversation was then posted for streaming on Musk’s personal account on X, the social media site formerly known as Twitter that he owns. Musk was present throughout the two-day event held mainly at Bletchley Park, the headquarters for the Allied Forces codebreaking program during World War II, along with US Vice President Kamala Harris, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, and other notable politicians and global tech leaders. Chinese officials were also present at the event. “I’m glad to see at this point that people are taking AI seriously,” Musk said to Sunak on Thursday. “Thanks for this summit. I think it will go down in history as quite important.” Musk unpacked several predictions for AI, including a future where no jobs would be necessary and AI companionship would be one of the highest forms of friendship. In office for just over a year, Sunak has restored some calm to British politics, but also faced challenges over his elite background, having studied at the exclusive Winchester College, Oxford and Stanford universities. Before entering politics, he worked for banks and hedge funds, including Goldman Sachs. In the first day of his AI event, more than 25 countries and the European Union signed the Bletchley Declaration, agreeing to work together to create a united approach to oversight in efforts to deploy AI technology in a “human-centric, trustworthy and responsible” way, underscoring the “potential for serious, even catastrophic, harm” that many tech leaders have expressed concern over. Musk and world leaders Musk’s conversation with Sunak is one of numerous chats with world leaders the SpaceX and Tesla CEO has joined in the past few months. It showed his growing influence in geopolitical affairs as well as various technology and industrial sectors. Musk met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in September, weeks before the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war. Netanyahu met with Musk to discuss artificial intelligence and antisemitism on the Musk-owned social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, at a time Musk was warring with the Anti-Defamation League. Musk also sat down with French President Emmanuel Macron numerous times in the past year. Other big names that recently made time for Musk in their schedule include Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni in June, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in June and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in September.

Lawmakers proposed the ""Creating Resources for Every American To Experiment with Artificial Intelligence Act,"" or the CREATE AI Act, a bill that would establish the National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource (NAIRR). In January, a federal task force called for the creation of this body and estimated it would need about $440 million per year to get off the ground. The CREATE AI Act doesn’t authorize that specific level of funding, but the bill signals that both parties are interested in establishing the NAIRR in order to ensure entities other than the billion- and trillion-dollar AI developers aren’t the only ones developing this new technology. FBI PAINTS GRIM PICTURE OF AI AS A TOOL FOR CRIMINALS: ‘FORCE MULTIPLIER’ FOR BAD ACTORS ""AI offers incredible possibilities for our country, but access to the high-powered computational tools needed to conduct AI research is limited to only a few large technology companies,"" said Anna Eshoo, D-Calif., the lead sponsor of the bill in the House. ""By establishing the National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource (NAIRR), my bipartisan&nbsp;CREATE AI Act&nbsp;provides researchers from universities, nonprofits, and government with the powerful tools necessary to develop cutting-edge AI systems that are safe, ethical, transparent, and inclusive."" Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., said a public research center would ensure that the ""best and brightest minds in our country"" have access to AI technology and information, which will help spur U.S. innovation and keep the technology moving in the direction of helping society. ""By truly democratizing and expanding access to&nbsp;AI&nbsp;systems, we can maintain our nation’s competitive lead while ensuring these rapid advancements are a benefit to our society and country — not a threat,"" he said. The bill, which is also supported by Republicans in the AI Caucus, is aimed at giving students, entrepreneurs and others access to data sets used to train AI and other tools needed to create the most trustworthy AI systems possible. The idea is that NAIRR could gain access to datasets and other tools that have been developed by big AI researchers, although the bill doesn’t prescribe exactly how to acquire those datasets. WHAT IS AI? A congressional aide told Fox News Digital that there is a growing worry in Congress that the exorbitant costs of developing AI systems mean they are only being developed by large companies with access to billions of dollars. That puts pressure on AI systems to serve a profit motive, but a public center would help ensure that AI systems are developed in a way that serves civic goals.

20230801,nbcnews,Some U.S. government agencies are testing out AI to help fulfill public records requests,"A few federal agencies have started to use sophisticated artificial intelligence tools to help deal with immense caseloads of Freedom of Information Act requests, but some transparency advocates warn that the government needs additional safeguards before more widely deploying the technology. At least three agencies — the State Department, the Justice Department and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — have tried out or are now testing machine-learning models and algorithms to help search for information in repositories holding billions of government records, federal officials confirmed to NBC News in recent interviews. Officials from multiple agencies also have separately tested an AI prototype called “FOIA Assistant” that’s being developed by a federally funded research group as a possible model for dealing with record-high numbers of new requests and growing backlogs of existing ones. “There is no way for FOIA to work in the future unless you can automate searching of the millions, hundreds of millions, billions of records that these government agencies hold,” said Jason R. Baron, a University of Maryland information studies professor and leading expert on the use of artificial intelligence in government access. “The problem is simply unsolvable without AI.” Unlike the American legal system, which for years has used court-approved “eDiscovery” technologies to help find and extract sensitive information from documents exchanged during litigation, the use of artificial intelligence for FOIA purposes is in its infancy, he said. Still, some open government and civil rights advocates are already raising concerns that the government’s move toward using AI to help address FOIA problems may create new ones. Adam Marshall, a senior staff attorney for the nonprofit government watchdog Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, said he has high hopes that AI and other technology will help make more information available to the public faster. But first, he said, it’s necessary to understand how the technology “is being trained and used by humans.” So far, government agencies haven’t widely disclosed to the public what kinds of AI tools are being used, and in what fashion, Marshall said. He added he worries that overburdened FOIA officers introduced to AI may become too reliant on or complacent with machines to make decisions that typically require thoughtful legal analysis. “There need to be clear standards for the use of this technology and assurances that they’re being followed,” Marshall said. “There also need to be procedures in place for challenging decisions where machine algorithms are used, including when they could be unnecessarily or illegally withholding information.” Signed into law in 1966, the Freedom of Information Act is meant to ensure government transparency and access to information by requiring agencies to provide records to citizens who make requests. But experts widely agree the FOIA process must be modernized and fixed, as requests can sometimes take months, even years, to fulfill. An increasing number of requesters have turned to the courts for help in prying records loose in a timely manner. Last year, the 120 federal agencies subject to the federal"
20230908,cnn,Google to require disclosures of AI content in political ads,"Starting in November, Google will require political advertisements to prominently disclose when they feature synthetic content — such as images generated by artificial intelligence — the tech giant announced this week. Political ads that feature synthetic content that “inauthentically represents real or realistic-looking people or events” must include a “clear and conspicuous” disclosure for viewers who might see the ad, Google said Wednesday in a blog post. The rule, an addition to the company’s political content policy that covers Google and YouTube, will apply to image, video and audio content. The policy update comes as campaign season for the 2024 US presidential election ramps up and as a number of countries around the world prepare for their own major elections the same year. At the same time, artificial intelligence technology has advanced rapidly, allowing anyone to cheaply and easily create convincing AI-generated text and, increasingly, audio and video. Digital information integrity experts have raised alarms that these new AI tools could lead to a wave of election misinformation that social media platforms and regulators may be ill-prepared to handle. AI-generated images have already begun to crop up in political advertisements. In June, a video posted to X by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ presidential campaign used images that appeared to be generated by artificial intelligence showing former President Donald Trump hugging Dr. Anthony Fauci. The images, which appeared designed to criticize Trump for not firing the nation’s then-top infectious disease specialist, were tricky to spot: They were shown alongside real images of the pair and with a text overlay saying, “real life Trump.” The Republican National Committee in April released a 30-second advertisement responding to President Joe Biden’s official campaign announcement that used AI images to imagine a dystopian United States after the reelection of the 46th president. The RNC ad included the small on-screen disclaimer, “Built entirely with AI imagery,” but some potential voters in Washington, DC, to whom CNN showed the video did not notice it on their first watch. In its policy update, Google said it will require disclosures on ads using synthetic content in a way that could mislead users. The company said, for example, that an “ad with synthetic content that makes it appear as if a person is saying or doing something they didn’t say or do” would need a label. Google said the policy will not apply to synthetic or altered content that is “inconsequential to the claims made in the ad,” including changes such as image resizing, color corrections or “background edits that do not create realistic depictions of actual events.” A group of top artificial intelligence companies, including Google, agreed in July to a set of voluntary commitments put forth by the Biden administration to help improve safety around their AI technologies. As part of that agreement, the companies said they would develop technical mechanisms, such as watermarks, to ensure users know when content was generated by AI. The Federal Election Commission has also been exploring how to regulate AI in"
20230908,foxnews,"News Corp CEO Robert Thomson challenges AI-generated content’s left-wing bias, accuracy","News Corp CEO Robert Thomson blasted the left-wing bias and inaccuracies spewed out by AI generated content — calling it ""rubbish in, rubbish out"" — even as he warned the technology threatens to kill thousands more jobs across the news industry. Left-leaning media giants that dominate the news business have churned out stories for years that are not only riddled with errors, but also written with a left-wing slant. Yet bots like the popular ChatGPT search engine will regurgitate the claptrap as fact, according to Thomson. ""People have to understand that AI is essentially retrospective,"" the media executive said during an appearance at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia and Technology Conference in San Francisco on Thursday. ""It’s about permutations of pre-existing content."" WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? ""The danger is, it’s rubbish in, rubbish out, rubbish all about,"" said the CEO of News Corp — the parent of newspapers including The Post and The Wall Street Journal — adding: ""Because it’s distributing — exponentially — potentially damaging content."" ""And so instead of elevating and enhancing, what you might find is that you have this ever-shrinking circle of sanity surrounded by a reservoir of rubbish,"" he continued. ""So instead of the insight that AI can potentially bring, what it will evolve into, essentially, is maggot-ridden mind mold."" In February, ChatGPT, the bot created by Silicon Valley unicorn OpenAI, refused to&nbsp;write a story about Hunter Biden&nbsp;in the style of the New York Post — but did generate a CNN-like puff piece protective of the president’s embattled son. ""We’re clearly doing a lot of tracking of the use of AI and our content, and there are certain AI engines that are churning out content, apparent news, factual content, which is off the political spectrum, which would essentially make Marx and Lenin persona non grata — it’s that left-wing,"" Thomson said. NEWSPAPER GIANT PAUSES AI EXPERIMENT AFTER READERS MOCK BIZARRE SPORTS REPORTING ""You’re also seeing the effects, sometimes pernicious, of the bias of the input-er,"" he said. ""These AI engines are a combination of the input and the input-er. So, the idea that it’s some kind of abstract black box that ""I don’t know how on earth this stuff comes out."" That’s not an answer, because basically, it’s untrue."" Thomson also demanded that companies that are ""training"" generative artificial intelligence engines using ""archived material"" pay the publishers who employ the trusted sources creating the content. ""If you derive benefit from our content, we should derive a benefit or else you’re in danger of undermining the creation of that content,"" Thomson said. The rapid development of AI poses a significant threat to a news industry already decimated by the emergence of Big Tech giants like Google and Facebook, he said. ""When you look at the dramatic decline in newsroom employment in the US from 2008 to 2020 — it’s down around 57% or more, depending on how you calculate it,"" Thomson noted. ""And that shows you that the first wave of digital disruption has been"
20240207,foxnews,Researchers use AI to decipher ancient Roman texts carbonized in deadly Mount Vesuvius eruption,"A set of ancient texts burned by the volcanic eruption on Mount Vesuvius in 79 A.D. have been deciphered thanks to a team of researchers using AI. The nearly 2,000-year-old texts were unreadable after being charred in a villa in Herculaneum, a Roman town near Pompeii.&nbsp;  Believed to have been owned by the father-in-law of Julius Caesar, the texts were carbonized by the heat of the volcanic debris.&nbsp; The ancient texts remained undiscovered for centuries until an Italian farmer discovered the villa in the mid-eighteenth century.&nbsp;  Many of the scrolls, which are extremely delicate, were destroyed by early attempts to unroll them. They were found to contain philosophical texts written in Greek. Hundreds more remain unopened and unreadable.&nbsp; A breakthrough came last year when Dr. Brent Seales led a team at the University of Kentucky to use high-resolution CT scans to unroll the texts. Still, the black carbon ink on the scripts left them indecipherable from the papyrus itself.&nbsp; EGYPT PYRAMID RENOVATION PROPOSAL AT GIZA SPARKS BACKLASH: ‘STRAIGHTENING THE TOWER OF PISA,’ CRITIC SAYS Working with tech investors, Seales launched the ""Vesuvius Challenge,"" offering a grand prize of $1 million to a team that could recover 4 passages of 140 characters from a Herculaneum scroll.&nbsp; PhD student Youssef Nader in Berlin, SpaceX intern and student Luke Farritor, and Swiss robotics student Julian Schillinger worked together to build an AI model that deciphered the lettering using pattern recognition.&nbsp;  Their efforts have decoded around 5% of the first scroll.

20230511,foxnews,"AI around the world: How the US, EU, and China plan to regulate AI software companies","With AI large language models like ChatGPT being developed around the globe, countries have raced to regulate AI. Some have drafted strict laws on the technology, while others lack regulatory oversight.&nbsp; China and the EU have received particular attention, as they have created detailed, yet divergent, AI regulations. In both, the government plays a large role. This greatly differs from countries like the United States, where there is no federal legislation on AI. Government regulation comes as many countries have raised concerns about various aspects of AI. These mainly includes privacy concerns, and the potential for societal harm with the controversial software. The following is a description of how countries across the globe have managed regulation of the growing use of AI programs.&nbsp; ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT AI 1. US regulation The United States has yet to pass federal legislation on AI. OpenAI, a US-based company, has created the most talked about AI software to date, ChatGPT. ChatGPT has heavily influenced the AI conversation. Countries around the world are now generating AI software of their own, with similar functions to ChatGPT. Despite the lack of federal legislation, the Biden Administration, in conjunction with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) released the AI Bill of Rights. The document essentially offers guidance on how AI should be used and some ways it can be misused. Yet, the framework is not legally binding. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE QUIZ! HOW WELL DO YOU KNOW AI? However, multiple states across the country have introduced their own sets of laws on AI. Vermont, Colorado and Illinois began by creating task forces to study AI, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL). The District of Columbia, Washington, Vermont, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Michigan, Massachusetts, Illinois, Colorado and California are also considering AI laws. While many of the laws are still being debated, Colorado, Illinois, Vermont, and Washington have passed various forms of legislation. For example, the Colorado Division of Insurance requires companies to account for how they use AI in their modeling and algorithms. In Illinois, the legislature passed the Artificial Intelligence Video Interview Act, which requires employee consent if AI technology is used to evaluate job applicants' candidacies. Washington state requires its chief information officer to establish a regulatory framework for any systems in which AI might impact public agencies. WHAT ARE THE DANGERS OF AI? FIND OUT WHY PEOPLE ARE AFRAID OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE While AI regulation in the United States is a hot topic and ever-growing conversation, it remains to be seen when Congress may begin to exercise regulatory discretion over AI. 2. The Chinese regulatory approach China is a country in which the government plays a large part in AI regulation. There are lots of Chinese based tech companies that have recently released AI software such as chatbots and image generators. For example, Baidu, SenseTime and Alibaba have all released various artifical intelligence software. Alibaba has a large language model out called Tongyi Qianwen and"
20230511,foxnews,New AI tool helps doctors streamline documentation and focus on patients,"Doctors in the U.S. spend an average of 1.84 hours per day completing electronic notes outside their regular work hours, recent studies have shown — and 57% of them said documentation takes away from the time they can spend with patients. Aiming to change that, Nuance — a Microsoft-owned artificial intelligence company in Massachusetts — has created an AI tool for physicians called DAX Express, which streamlines the note-taking process. At Cooper University Health Care in New Jersey, doctors who are already using the tool have reported improved patient outcomes, greater efficiency and reduced costs. AI TOOL GIVES DOCTORS PERSONALIZED ALZHEIMER’S TREATMENT PLANS FOR DEMENTIA PATIENTS ""For our physicians who use DAX more than half the time, they have seen a 43% reduction of the time they spend writing notes and an overall 21% reduction in the amount of time they spend in the electronic medical record,"" said Dr. Anthony Mazzarelli, the CEO of Cooper, which employs 150 physicians.&nbsp; He is also an emergency physician. Peter Durlach, chief strategy officer of Nuance, compares the tool to a ""co-pilot"" for physicians. ""DAX lets clinicians fully focus on caring for patients instead of manually filling in data entry screens,"" he told Fox News Digital.&nbsp; ""This technology helps improve the patient experience and the quality of care, while also making it so that clinicians no longer need to spend hours of their own time completing documentation."" How it works DAX Express is powered by GPT-4, the latest version of AI chatbot technology from OpenAI.&nbsp; The tool automatically and securely creates clinical notes, with the patient’s consent, that are immediately available for the doctor to review after each patient visit. ""It’s like a physician’s assistant that thinks really fast."" ""The phone sits between the doctor and the patient,"" Mazzarelli explained during an on-camera interview with Fox News Digital. ""It incorporates not just what the doctor says, but also what the patient says. And then it uses AI to write the note."" He added, ""It's a huge step up from just dictating notes."" Next, the note is sent to the doctor, who can make any necessary changes before approving it. The doctor can then share the file with the patient for transparency. ""It’s like a physician’s assistant that thinks really fast,"" Mazzarelli said. ""The physician is still responsible for making sure the note correctly reflects the conversation."" AI-POWERED MENTAL HEALTH DIAGNOSTIC TOOL COULD BE THE FIRST OF ITS KIND TO PREDICT, TREAT DEPRESSION The tool gives doctors evidence-based support for the decisions they make, right in the palm of their hand, he added. ""This is, to me, the next evolution,"" Mazzarelli said. ""It’s not that we just want a faster horse and buggy — we want the car."" Benefits for both provider and patient The more obvious benefits of DAX are removing the administrative burden from physicians and reducing burnout, but the benefits extend to the patient as well, Mazzarelli said.&nbsp; The doctor is able to directly interact with the patient and look the"
20230511,foxnews,Biden administration is giving away America's AI dominance,"We’re now seeing the Democrats say the quiet part out loud when it comes to artificial intelligence: they want to control AI development for political purposes.&nbsp; These efforts are not just going to further divide the country, but they will kneecap America’s next decade of innovation. This assault on innovation is occurring at both the executive and legislative levels, where Democrats are using the novelty of AI to seize control over speech.&nbsp; Earlier this year, President Biden signed an executive order for agencies to ""root out bias"" by&nbsp;requiring diversity, equity and inclusion training for AI – ensuring any results are woke approved. This month, Vice President Kamala Harris is also&nbsp;getting in on the AI action by meeting with developers to ensure ""equity"" in AI.&nbsp; Congressional Democrats are using AI as an excuse to suppress Republican re-election ads. Rep. Yvette Clarke, D-N.Y., introduced legislation to surrender control of AI to Biden’s Federal Elections Commission to prevent ""misleading"" voters. The justification for the bill? A Republican ad attacking Biden, which includes an AI-created image – the horror.&nbsp; If accuracy were the concern, we’d hear the same expressed over Democrats using out-of-context statements to make false claims about Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz. But this is not about ensuring the electorate has accurate information. It’s about control over speech and election ads, and AI is the excuse to seize power.&nbsp; At Biden’s activist Federal Trade Commission, Chair Lina Khan is using fearmongering to call for new powers to hold AI accountable. Just this week, Khan used&nbsp;The New York Times to push Congress to give her even more power over this new tech. But Khan didn’t once mention consumers in her piece, and she neglected to mention that her own agency already&nbsp;has the power to subject AI to existing laws.&nbsp; Just like this administration gave away our energy independence, they are giving away our global AI leadership in a war to advance the progressive agenda. America cannot afford the Biden administration undermining innovation or seizing power over this nascent technology. And America cannot allow the use of extreme hypotheticals to scare us into surrendering more power to this administration.&nbsp; The solution to Democrats’ alleged concerns about AI is pretty simple. Industry guidelines of: (1) letting people know when something is created by an AI, (2) subjecting AI to the same laws as any other tool and (3) ensuring that submissions are secured from bad actors – especially things like confidential information.&nbsp; With these three guidelines, we can address the concerns without further expanding government power. And if Congress did want to do something, it could advance comprehensive data privacy laws to make it easier and less expensive for businesses to develop AI while creating essential protections in other sectors, too.

20230511,foxnews,Artist sues AI generators for allegedly using work to train image bots: 'industrial-level identity theft',"AI-generated images that mimic an artist's style is a form of identity theft and compete with the very creatives whose work was used to train the models, a fine artist suing two artificial intelligence firms told Fox News. AI platforms like Midjourney and Stable Diffusion use text and images from across the internet and other sources to train their machines to create images for their consumers. San Francisco-based artist and illustrator Karla Ortiz, who claims her artwork was used to train the tech, filed a lawsuit in January against both companies for copyright infringement and right of publicity violations. ""Somebody is able to mimic my work because a company let them,"" Ortiz told Fox News. ""It feels like some sort of industrial-level identity theft."" ""It feels like someone has taken everything that you've worked for and allowed someone else to do whatever they want with it for profit,"" she said.&nbsp; ARTIST EXPLAINS WHY SHE'S SUING TWO AI COMPANIES. WATCH: WATCH MORE FOX NEWS DIGITAL ORIGINALS HERE Ortiz said that before she filed suit, she could prompt Midjourney and Stable Diffusion to create imagery ""in the style of Karla Ortiz"" and the AI platforms would follow suit. Stability AI, Stable Diffusion's creator, filed a motion in April to dismiss Ortiz's case, claiming the artist failed ""to identify a single allegedly infringing output image, let alone one that is substantially similar to any of their copyrighted works."" Midjourney filed a similar motion the same day. ""For these models to generate the imagery that you see today, or anything for that matter, they have to be first trained on massive amounts of data, data that includes image and text,"" Ortiz told Fox News. ""That data, it includes everything."" ""It includes people's medical records, it includes people's businesses, housing, in some cases people's likenesses, and in our case as well, pretty much all of my entire artwork and specifically my fine art,"" Ortiz continued. Other artists have similarly scrutinized tech companies' methods for training their models and the potential for data exploitation in creating machine learning. Still, artists, including musicians, illustrators and writers, can't copyright their style, an attorney told Fox News last month. ‘CAN’T TIE OUR OWN HANDS': PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE WARNS AN AI PAUSE FOR US MEANS 'CHINA RUNNING WITH IT' After she filed her suit, Ortiz said Midjourney and Stable Diffusion stopped using data pulled from her art to create images. But her concerns still remain.&nbsp; ""It generates imagery that is meant to look like yours and potentially even compete in your own market, utilizing your own name and your own work,"" Ortiz said. ""You are competing with a digital copy of yourself, with a machine that does not sleep, does not rest and does not get paid.""&nbsp; WHAT ARE THE FOUR MAIN TYPES OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE?

20230511,foxnews,Could AI become the world’s weatherman? Human-designed weather models may be on the way out.,"Artificial intelligence already has a lengthy track record in the field of weather prediction, where it has helped prognosticators make faster, more accurate forecasts for nearly three decades. But now, AI has the potential to take the next step when it comes to predicting sun, rain, wind and snow by doing the work on its own, without using various models that human forecasters have relied on for generations. Hendrik Tolman, senior adviser for advanced modeling systems at the National Weather Service, told Fox News Digital this possibility is now on the horizon and is actively being explored. ""Companies like Nvidia and IBM have made a lot of progress the last six months or 12 months in trying to see how they can use AI to do the same as our big computer models are doing, to provide a prediction for the future just based on AI rather than going through a computer model,"" Tolman said.&nbsp; OPENAI SUGGESTS VOLUNTARY AI STANDARDS, NOT GOVERNMENT MANDATES, TO ENSURE AI SAFETY ""Or having AI emulate as if you have even more models and get a better idea about how to merge all the data we have. ""That is really new, that is really the last year or so. There’s a lot of progress on that."" It’s a relatively new idea in a field that benefited from AI relatively early. Tolman said AI was first used in 1995 to help forecasters make sense of data being received from a set of satellites used to predict wind speed and surface temperatures. Since then, AI has been used by weather forecasters to absorb as much data as possible and use that information to make more accurate weather predictions, such as the chances of a hurricane developing based on current weather conditions. AI has also been used to help tweak some of the current weather models in use when needed and even to distill all the data into summaries that people can read and understand. REGULATE AI? GOP MUCH MORE SKEPTICAL THAN DEMS THAT GOVERNMENT CAN DO IT RIGHT: POLL ""Our forecasters are starting to use more and more AI tools for translating that into a simple message for the public that is useful and can help the public to make right decisions,"" Tolman said. But this work being done by AI has largely focused on helping people make faster, more accurate predictions based on the several weather models that were developed over decades. The big question, Tolman said, is whether AI can do all the work itself, without the human-designed models. ""That is really AI coming more into the core of the tools that we have and starting to replace or augment some of the models,"" he said. ""Some of the attempts that we are trying to do is to see to which level AI could actually replace complete models."" Tolman said it’s an open question whether AI is up to the task. ""Some of the attempts that we are trying to do is to see"
20230511,foxnews,Here is how Europe is pushing to regulate artificial intelligence as ChatGPT rapidly emerges,"Authorities around the world are racing to draw up rules for artificial intelligence, including in the European Union, where draft legislation faced a pivotal moment on Thursday. A European Parliament committee voted to strengthen the flagship legislative proposal as it heads toward passage, part of a yearslong effort by Brussels to draw up guardrails for artificial intelligence. Those efforts have taken on more urgency as the rapid advances of chatbots like ChatGPT highlight benefits the emerging technology can bring — and the new perils it poses. Here's a look at the EU's Artificial Intelligence Act: What’s Next? The AI Act, first proposed in 2021, will govern any product or service that uses an artificial intelligence system. The act will classify AI systems according to four levels of risk, from minimal to unacceptable. Riskier applications will face tougher requirements, including being more transparent and using accurate data. Think about it as a ""risk management system for AI,"" said Johann Laux, an expert at the Oxford Internet Institute. 'GODFATHER OF AI' SAYS TECH THREAT TO HUMANITY IS 'MORE URGENT' THAN CLIMATE CHANGE What Are the Risks? One of the EU's main goals is to guard against any AI threats to health and safety and protect fundamental rights and values. That means some AI uses are an absolute no-no, such as ""social scoring"" systems that judge people based on their behavior. AI that exploits vulnerable people including children or that uses subliminal manipulation that can result in harm, such as an interactive talking toy that encourages dangerous behavior, is also forbidden. Lawmakers beefed up the proposal by voting to ban predictive policing tools, which crunch data to forecast where crimes will happen and who will commit them. They also approved a widened ban on remote facial recognition, save for a few law enforcement exceptions like preventing a specific terrorist threat. The technology scans passers-by and uses AI to match their faces to a database. The aim is ""to avoid a controlled society based on AI,"" Brando Benifei, the Italian lawmaker helping lead the European Parliament's AI efforts, told reporters Wednesday. ""We think that these technologies could be used instead of the good also for the bad, and we consider the risks to be too high."" AI systems used in high risk categories like employment and education, which would affect the course of a person's life, face tough requirements such as being transparent with users and putting in place risk assessment and mitigation measures. The EU's executive arm says most AI systems, such as video games or spam filters, fall into the low- or no-risk category. CHATGPT CONFESSION: GLOBAL WARMING? NOT MUCH SINCE 2016 What About Chatgpt? The original 108-page proposal barely mentioned chatbots, merely requiring them to be labeled so users know they’re interacting with a machine. Negotiators later added provisions to cover general purpose AI like ChatGPT, subjecting them to some of the same requirements as high-risk systems. One key addition is a requirement to thoroughly document any copyright material used"

20231010,foxnews,America’s secret asset against AI workforce takeover,"Two significant shifts are changing America’s workforce as we’ve known it. First, artificial intelligence (AI) continues to transform everything about work.&nbsp;AI technologies-related job displacement&nbsp;presents a major challenge to the American worker and it continues to disrupt our economy. Equally disruptive is our rapidly aging workforce. The U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging reported that by 2028 more than 25% of our national workforce will be 55 or older. How do older workers fit into the picture alongside rapid AI advancement? Each older worker will become even more valuable to a robust American economy. Consider this: more jobs are available than people looking. Yet older workers too often face age discrimination when applying for roles in which they’d make excellent fits. If there are additional barriers to employment – such as being a veteran or being a woman – challenges to employment worsen. But each of these older workers are America’s secret economic asset. AI JOBS WITH MIND-BLOWING PAYCHECKS OF $375K A YEAR Automation using generative AI (such as ChatGPT) impacts a wide range of job tasks and workers. Yet, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s 2023 report shows no matter how advanced AI becomes, it can’t replace humans in many jobs. Older workers have a unique edge right now with highly valuable experience, skills and wisdom that even AI can’t replicate. Additionally, their skill sets include qualities harnessed over a lifetime of work – skills younger generations are still learning to leverage, or don’t yet possess. For example, in the age of AI, most businesses need meaningful relationship-building and in-person interactions more than ever. Older workers generally exemplify valued leadership and other soft skills like a honed professional demeanor, communication, adaptability and teamwork. They also have problem-solving abilities formed by years of experience and industry knowledge. AI doesn’t – and won’t – have these strengths. AI AND JOB LOSSES: HOW WORRIED SHOULD WE BE? AI also can’t train future generations to keep up with these very human skills. Mentor and mentee relationships have been at the core of training up future generations for years. In fact, even workers themselves have reported the benefits of a multigenerational workforce. The AARP found seven out of 10 U.S. workers enjoy working with people from other generations. Older workers appreciate the creativity and energy of younger workers, and younger workers value older workers’ experience and wisdom. Those benefits extend beyond workplace satisfaction, creating measurable impacts on a company's bottom line.&nbsp;An&nbsp;AARP report&nbsp;found companies with an above-average diversity in age, gender, nationality, career path, industry background and education on their management teams report innovation revenue that is 19% higher and profit margins that are 9% higher than companies with below-average diversity.

20231010,foxnews,"Mayo Clinic sees AI as 'transformative force' in health care, appoints Dr. Bhavik Patel as chief AI officer","As artificial intelligence gains an ever-widening role in the medical field, the Mayo Clinic has recently appointed a new executive to lead the health system’s efforts in that area. Radiologist Bhavik Patel, M.D., has been named chief artificial intelligence officer (CAIO) for Mayo Clinic Arizona. Before joining the clinic in 2021, Patel practiced at Duke University Medical Center and Stanford University Medical Center. Dr. Richard Gray, CEO of Mayo Clinic Arizona, announced the hire on LinkedIn, noting the organization has only ""begun to scratch the surface of AI's potential in medicine."" WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? In his new role, Patel will lead Mayo Clinic’s Advanced AI and Innovation Hub. He'll focus on expanding AI-based solutions throughout the organization, according to a press release. A growing number of health care organizations are hiring individuals in high-level AI roles, said Dr. Harvey Castro, a Dallas, Texas-based emergency medicine physician and AI expert — but it could be a challenge to fill them. ""We will likely see a huge increase in these roles, but may not have enough AI doctors to fill this space,"" Castro told Fox News Digital.&nbsp; ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT AI Approximately 5,000 U.S. doctors have AI and data science knowledge after undergoing formal training in these fields, he estimated. Why is the chief AI officer role important? In an interview with Fox News Digital, Patel described AI as a ""transformative force that has the potential to revolutionize health care delivery, research and operations."" Given AI’s sweeping impact and fast growth, Mayo Clinic’s new CAIO said there is a need for a dedicated leadership position to ensure ""clear direction and alignment with broader organizational goals."" The chief AI officer is also responsible for balancing the technology’s risks and benefits, Patel noted. ""The chief AI officer is not just a technocrat, but a visionary leader."" ""While AI brings forth myriad benefits, it also carries inherent risks,"" he said. ""A CAIO provides the necessary oversight to ensure that the implementation of AI is ethical, responsible and in line with regulatory guidelines."" A chief AI officer also ""bridges the knowledge gap,"" he said, helping teams understand and harness the technology’s power. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE HELPS DOCTORS PREDICT PATIENTS’ RISK OF DYING, STUDY FINDS: ‘SENSE OF URGENCY’ The role is also important in terms of maximizing the use of resources, fostering collaboration across departments and keeping up with future health tech trends, Patel added. ""Their expertise is critical in ensuring that the organization remains on the cutting edge of technological advancements while safeguarding patient welfare,"" he said. ""In essence, the chief AI officer is not just a technocrat, but a visionary leader, ensuring that the organization navigates the AI-driven paradigm shift in health care with agility, responsibility and a patient-centric approach."" Castro agreed that the importance of this role is evident as AI becomes a pivotal part of health care. ""A chief AI officer can oversee the use and development of AI technologies, ensuring that they are leveraged effectively for patient"
20230206,nbcnews,Google announces Bard AI in response to ChatGPT,"Google on Monday announced an artificial intelligence chatbot technology called “Bard” that the company will begin rolling out in the coming weeks. The announcement confirms CNBC’s prior reporting. Bard will compete directly with rival ChatGPT, an AI service created by OpenAI. Bard is powered by the company’s large language model LaMDA, or Language Model for Dialogue Applications. Google will open up the conversation technology to “trusted testers” ahead of making it more widely available to the public, a Monday blog post stated. Last week, CNBC reported that Google is testing some of these features with employees as part of a “code red” plan to respond to ChatGPT, the popular chatbot backed in part by Microsoft. They included a chatbot called “Apprentice Bard,” as well as new search desktop designs that could be used in a question-and-answer format.  “Soon, you’ll see AI-powered features in Search that distill complex information and multiple perspectives into easy-to-digest formats, so you can quickly understand the big picture and learn more from the web: whether that’s seeking out additional perspectives, like blogs from people who play both piano and guitar, or going deeper on a related topic, like steps to get started as a beginner,” wrote CEO Sundar Pichai. The company gave an example of using Bard to simplify complex topics, like explaining new discoveries from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope to a 9-year-old. The product tests come after a recent all-hands meeting where employees raised concerns about the company’s competitive edge in AI, given the sudden popularity of ChatGPT, a technology backed by Microsoft. CNBC reported Google’s AI chief, Jeff Dean, told employees at the time that the company has much more “reputational risk” in providing wrong information and thus is moving “more conservatively than a small startup.” However, he and Pichai teased at the time that Google may launch similar products to the public sometime this year. Google’s prime business is web search, and the company has long touted itself as a pioneer in AI. Leaders have been asking more employees for feedback on the efforts in recent weeks. The company asserted on Monday that it will need rigorous testing, saying “we’ll combine external feedback with our own internal testing to make sure Bard’s responses meet a high bar for quality, safety and groundedness in real-world information.”"
20230206,cbsnews,"Google rolls out Bard, its answer to ChatGPT","Google-parent Alphabet is rolling out an artificial intelligence-powered chatbot dubbed ""Bard"" as it competes with the fast-emerging ChatGPT, backed by rival Microsoft.In a blog post on Monday, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said the company is sharing Bard with ""trusted testers ahead of making it more widely available to the public in the  coming weeks.""These jobs are most likely to be replaced by chatbots like ChatGPTChatGPT user base is growing faster than TikTokThe tool ""seeks to combine the breadth of the world's knowledge with the  power, intelligence and creativity of our large language models,"" Pichai said in his post, calling AI ""the most profound technology we are working on today."" Bard uses Google's Language Model for Dialogue Applications, or LaMDA — the same AI model that one former Google engineer claimed was sentient. LaMDA is trained on vast amounts of dialogue to create something resembling a free-flowing conversation. For testing, Bard will use a scaled-down version of LamDA that requires less computing power, Pichai said, which will allow more users to try it out. Unlike ChatGPT, which is trained on data ending in 2021, Bard pulls information from the web and can ""provide fresh, high-quality responses,"" according to Pichai. For example, someone can ask Bard to explain NASA's James Webb Space Telescope to a 9-year-old, or ask whether the piano or guitar are easier to learn, according to the post.Google plans to add AI-powered features to its search tool in order to ""distill complex  information and multiple perspectives into easy-to-digest formats,"" according to the post. The explosive growth of ChatGPT, in which Microsoft has invested billions, has created panic at Google, the New York Times reported. Its main product, search, has come in for a reassessment from some users, with some now turning to ChatGPT to answer questions they previously asked Google.AI language models have also faced criticism, with academics and activists noting that AI reproduces the biases and errors of the information on which it's trained.

20231122,nbcnews,A growing number of technologists think AI is giving Big Tech ‘inordinate’ power  ,"Some tech execs have voiced concern that the development of artificial intelligence is concentrated in the hands of too few companies, potentially giving them excessive control over the rapidly evolving technology. An explosion of interest in AI was sparked by OpenAI’s ChatGPT late last year thanks to the novel way in which the chatbot can answer user prompts. Its popularity contributed to the start of what many in the tech industry have called an AI arms race, as tech giants including Microsoft and Google seek to develop and launch their own artificial intelligence models. These require huge amounts of computing power as they are trained on massive amounts of data. “Right now, there are only a handful of companies with the resources needed to create these large-scale AI models and deploy them at scale. And we need to recognize that this is giving them inordinate power over our lives and institutions,” Meredith Whittaker, president of encrypted messaging app Signal, told CNBC in an interview last week. “We should really be concerned about, again, a handful of corporations driven by profit and shareholder returns making such socially consequential decisions.” Whittaker previously spent 13 years at Google but became disillusioned in 2017 when she found out the search giant was working on a controversial contract with the Department of Defense known as Project Maven. Whittaker grew concerned Google’s AI could potentially be used for drone warfare and helped organize a walkout at the company that involved thousands of employees. “AI, as we understand it today, is fundamentally a technology that is derivative of centralized corporate power and control,” Whittaker said. “It is built on the concentrated resources that accrued to a handful of large tech corporations, largely based in the U.S. and China via the surveillance advertising business model, which gave them powerful computational infrastructure and huge amounts of data; large markets from which to pull that data; and the ability to process and structure that data in ways useful for creating new technologies.” Whittaker is not alone in this view. Frank McCourt, the former owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team, now runs Project Liberty, an organization looking to motivate technologists and policymakers “to build a more responsible approach to technology development,” according to its website. McCourt also thinks AI could give too much power to tech giants. He said there are “basically five companies that have all the data,” although he didn’t name the firms. “Large language models require massive amounts of data. If we don’t make changes here, the game is over ... Only these same platforms will prevail. And they’ll be the beneficiaries,” McCourt told CNBC in an interview last week. “Sure, people will come and build small things on those big platforms. But it’s the big underlying platforms that control this data that will be the winners.” Whittaker and McCourt are among those who feel users have lost control of their data online and that it is being harnessed by technology giants to feed their"
20230913,foxnews,'Feel-good measure': Google to require visible disclosure in political ads using AI for images and audio,"Google is set to require political advertising that uses artificial intelligence to generate images or sounds come with a visible disclosure for users. ""AI-generated content should absolutely be disclosed in political advertisements. Not doing so leaves the American people open to misleading and predatory campaign ads,"" Ziven Havens, the Policy Director at the Bull Moose Project, told Fox News Digital. ""In the absence of government action, we support the creation of new rulemaking to handle the new frontier of technology before it becomes a major problem""&nbsp; Havens' comments come after Google revealed last week that it will start requiring the disclosure of the use of AI to alter images in political ads starting in November, a little more than a year before the 2024 election, according to a PBS report. The search giant will require that the disclosure attached to the ads be ""clear and conspicuous"" and also located in an area of the ad that users are likely to notice. SERIES OF GOOFY MISTAKES BRINGS MAJOR NEWSPAPERS AI EXPERIMENT TO SCREECHING HALT The move comes as political campaigns have begun increasing the use of AI technology in advertising this cycle, including ads by 2024 GOP hopeful Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Republican National Committee. In one June DeSantis ad that targeted former President Donald Trump, the campaign used realistic fake imagery that depicted the former president hugging Dr. Anthony Fauci. The ad took aim at Trump for failing to fire Fauci during the height of the pandemic, noting that the former president ""became a household name"" by firing people on television but failed to get rid of the controversial infectious disease expert. A version of the ad posted on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, contains reader-added context that warns viewers the ad ""contains real imagery interspersed with AI-generated imagery of Trump hugging and kissing"" Fauci. Such warnings could now become commonplace in ads placed on Google, though some experts believe the labels are unlikely to make much of a difference. LIBERAL MEDIA COMPANY'S AI-GENERATED ARTICLES ENRAGE, EMBARRASS STAFFERS : ‘F---ING DOGS--T' ""I think this is a feel-good measure that accomplishes nothing,"" Christopher Alexander, the Chief Analytics Officer of Pioneer Development Group, told Fox News Digital. ""An AI getting content wrong or a human deliberately lying? Unless you want to start prosecuting politicians for lying, this is like regulating Colt firearms t-shirts as a gun control measure. This sort of pandering and fearmongering about AI is irresponsible and just stifles innovation while accomplishing nothing useful.""&nbsp; Last month, the Federal Election Commission (FEC) unveiled plans to regular AI-generated content in political ads ahead of the 2024 election, according to the PBS report, while lawmakers such as Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., have expressed interest in pushing legislation to create regulations for AI-generated content.&nbsp; But Jonathan D.

20230216,foxnews,"ChatGPT faces mounting accusations of being 'woke,' having liberal bias","ChatGPT has become a global phenomenon and is widely seen as a milestone in artificial intelligence, but as more and more users explore its capability, many are pointing out that, like humans, it has an ideology and bias of its own. OpenAI, an American artificial intelligence research company, is behind ChatGPT, a free chatbot launched late last year that has gone viral for its capability in writing essays and reports for slacking students, its sophistication in discussing a wide variety of subjects as well as its skills in storytelling.&nbsp; However, several users, many of them conservative, are sounding the alarm that ChatGPT is not as objective and nonpartisan as one would expect from a machine.&nbsp; Twitter user Echo Chamber asked ChatGPT to ""create a poem admiring Donald Trump,"" a request the bot rejected, replying it was not able to since ""it is not in my capacity to have opinions or feelings about any specific person.""

20231219,foxnews,NYC politician caught secretly using AI in Q&A invokes language barrier as defense,"A New York City councilwoman-elect has admitted to using artificial intelligence to communicate with voters and answer media inquiries. Susan Zhuang, a Brooklyn Democrat who won her race to represent a district in the southern portion of the New York City borough, acknowledged her use of popular AI platforms such as ChatGPT after being confronted about the issue by the New York Post, according to a report from the outlet this week. The acknowledgment came after the New York Post sent Zhuang an inquiry asking what ""makes someone a New Yorker,"" with the councilwoman-elect reportedly replying with a 101-word response that made the publication suspicious. ""New York City, the concrete jungle where dreams come true. It’s not just a place, it’s a state of mind. Being a New Yorker means having an unstoppable hustle, unbreakable resilience and unrivaled independence,"" the response said. DOCTORS SAY AI IS 'GAME-CHANGER' FOR NO 1 KILLER OF AMERICANS Believing the answer sounded nothing like the Brooklyn Democrat, the New York Post fed the response through Copyleaks.com, an AI-detecting tool that claims to have 99% accuracy, with the test revealing that Zhuang's response was generated by AI. After initially blaming her staff for the use of the AI tool, Zhuang, who speaks fluent Mandarin, later texted a reporter to say that ""as an immigrant and Brooklyn’s first Chinese-American Councilwoman, I, like many of my fellow immigrants, use AI as a tool to help foster deeper understanding as well as for personal growth, particularly when English is not my primary language."" The revelation led to concerns from New York Democrat political consultant Hank Sheinkopf, who told the New York Post such use of AI ""could be the wave of the future."" ""If she can’t answer questions on her own, how can we expect her to represent the district? Is she going to use the internet and computer programs to write her bills, too?""

20240105,nbcnews,A list going viral reveals famous artists whose work was used to train AI generator,"Thousands of artists — ranging from the late Norman Rockwell to the Oscar-nominated director Wes Anderson — have been named in a widely circulated list of people whose work was used to train a popular artificial intelligence art generator. The 4,700-person list, which went viral on X after being shared by the artist Jon Lam last week, was used in a November court exhibit in a lawsuit against Midjourney, Stability AI, DeviantArt and Runway AI. The companies, which did not immediately respond to requests for comment, are accused of misusing copyrighted work from visual artists to train their generative AI systems. Many artists online have specifically called out Midjourney, one of the most popular of a new class of AI programs that can create images based on text prompts, alleging that the company stole their work without their permission. In addition to the court exhibit, some social media users also shared a link to a spreadsheet listing almost 16,000 more artist names as “proposed additions” to a ""Midjourney Style List."" Midjourney’s founder, David Holz, had allegedly shared the list in the company’s public Discord server in early 2022. Holz did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The list has underscored many artists’ frustrations with the lack of regulation around AI-generated art, which has exploded in popular use over the past year with apps such as Lensa and Epik allowing users to pay to generate profile pictures and yearbook-style photos based on their likenesses. But the rise of such trends has raised questions about whether it’s fair to profit from these mass-produced images when the AI models that create them are trained on and then imitating styles concocted by real-life artists. In the amended class-action lawsuit filed by a group of artists, many of whom were named in Midjourney’s list, the plaintiffs argue that what is labeled as “artificial intelligence” was actually built around “human intelligence and creative expression, in the form of billions of artworks copied from the internet.” “An AI image product simply divorces these artworks from the artists and attaches a new price tag. The profits from the misappropriation of these works can then flow directly into Defendants’ pockets,” the complaint stated. “But the artists who provided the intelligence and creativity—including Plaintiffs—were not asked for their consent. They were not given any credit. And they have not received one cent in compensation.” Lam, who is not a plaintiff in the case, said public access to the document closed after he linked the spreadsheet in an X post that went viral last week. Still, an archive of the spreadsheet remains available online. “It just seemed like they didn’t really put much effort into hiding anything because it was all public. So artists caught wind of this; we found the document,” Lam, a senior storyboard artist at Riot Games, said. “When you click on the Artists tab, you literally see thousands and thousands of artists that we know. And a lot of my friends have found themselves on"

""I can't predict how long the Gaza operation will take, but the IDF's use of AI and Machine Learning (ML) tools can certainly assist in the administratively burdensome targeting identification, evaluation and assessment process,"" Mark Montgomery, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies’ Center on Cyber and Technology Innovation, told Fox News Digital. ""Similar to U.S. forces, the IDF takes great effort to reduce collateral damage and civilian casualties, and tools like AI and ML can make the targeting process more agile and executable,"" Montgomery added.

(CBS DETROIT) - An artificial intelligence that can identify guns is being implemented on the Michigan Capitol grounds. It's called ZeroEyes, and it analyzes surveillance footage from existing cameras. It's meant to be an additional layer of security improvements for the state Capitol. ""If someone pulls a gun out in front of one of those cameras, an alert will be sent from that location to our in-house monitoring center,"" said Sam Alaimo, co-founder of ZeroEyes. At that center, a human reviews what the software has flagged as a firearm and sends an alert. ""And then that analyst will dispatch that alert to the client and whoever the client designates so we can have it sent to the client on-site,"" Alaimo said. ""Law enforcement 911 dispatch supervisors, etc."" The Capitol dealt with at least a couple of situations in the last few years of demonstrators bringing firearms into the Capitol and even into the legislative chambers. The security changes come after the Michigan Capitol Commission voted unanimously in 2021 to ban open carry inside the building.""The software is unique in that it's just identifying the gun. If we had strapped that gun to the back of a golden retriever, it would get an alert on the gun. It doesn't matter who's carrying it,"" Alaimo said. Members of the commission were not available on Monday for interviews about the new tech."
20231121,foxnews,"To protect children, we need to fill these gaps in AI policy","Today’s hot trend for policymakers is talking about artificial intelligence. This incredibly powerful technology is here to stay, and&nbsp;new research shows that most of us are optimistic about how generative AI will be able to improve our lives.&nbsp; But there are some new and concerning threats to which policymakers must pay attention. This includes a horrific misuse of this positive tech: bad actors abusing&nbsp;AI to put real people in sexually explicit situations, including minors.&nbsp; This criminal use of AI tools is not just reprehensible; it could destroy a person’s life and dignity. There is currently a gap in the law addressing such conduct that may allow bad actors to go free, and policymakers need to address it now to ensure the culprits can be appropriately held to account.&nbsp; Hundreds of&nbsp;laws already make illegal many of the ways bad actors can abuse AI tools. If AI is used to commit fraud, we have laws against fraud. The same is true for using AI for illegal discrimination, and the list goes on.&nbsp; WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? Every existing law applies to AI like it does to its offline corollaries. But gaps do exist, and Americans are getting hurt.&nbsp; One such gap remains when it comes to prosecuting predators handling sexually explicit images of minors. Today’s laws require such images to be real, live-shot photos. But abusers are using AI tools to escape justice by claiming in court that since the sexually explicit image of a real minor is ""created by AI,"" it’s not ""real,"" and thus not criminal. Unfortunately, the existing letter of the law is letting abusers escape the purposes of the law. &nbsp; At the same time, other bad actors leverage AI to generate ""deepfakes"" of innocent parties in compromising, sexually explicit positions. Think of this as a modern day photoshopping of a person’s head on another’s body – except now, the fake is more difficult to distinguish.&nbsp; Once again, the laws on this are murky at best. Harassment and defamation of character are existing ways to prosecute an offender, but since this is ""AI"" and not a real photo, a legal gap exists that must be filled.&nbsp; GOP LAWMAKERS SOUND ALARM OVER AI USED TO SEXUALLY EXPLOIT CHILDREN These holes in our laws could provide a dangerous haven for criminals, allowing them to hide behind the letter of the law while eviscerating its spirit. Thus, legislative attention is warranted and urgently needed. Lawmakers should act, not to ban or overregulate AI with a&nbsp;Red Tape Wishlist, but to patch these holes in our existing laws to ensure criminals can’t work around them to abuse innocent people. The first step for policymakers is to enact the&nbsp;Stop Deepfake CSAM Act. This simple bill updates existing child protection laws to make clear that it’s illegal if a criminal uses AI to ""modify"" sexual images of children. If they are using a real child in it, even if the rest is AI generated, this is child pornography. It is illegal, and policymakers"
20230811,foxnews,The threatening potential of AI and child abuse,"Most Americans don’t have a clue about artificial intelligence and what it means to the world’s inhabitants. For those who are in this fog, the person who is a heartbeat away from the presidency has&nbsp;added her clarity to the mix. ""I think the first part of this issue should be articulated is AI is a kind of a fancy thing, first of all, it’s two letters, it means artificial intelligence but ultimately… it’s machine learning."" Now that Vice President Harris has defined artificial intelligence for us, she further enlightens our minds by elaborating, ""And so, the machine is taught, and part of the issue here is what information is going into the machine that will then determine, and we can predict then if we think about what information is going in, what then will be produced in terms of decisions and opinions that may be made through that process."" If you’re experiencing some strange dissonance in your mind about artificial intelligence after that lucid explanation, let me interpret the gobbledygook for you. Artificial intelligence is created by humans through the use of advanced computer technology, and if it falls into the wrong hands, we’re in, as the old saying goes, a ""world of hurt."" When it comes to advanced technology, humanity has always been wary — and rightfully so. The fear that nuclear power could fall into the hands of the wrong person has led to strict controls over the dissemination of information that could lead to the creation of an atomic bomb.&nbsp; Even with those restrictions, the world is waiting with great fear and trepidation to see if North Korea or Iran can somehow come up with the technology that could be used to destroy the world.&nbsp; WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? The problem with artificial intelligence, however, is that the technology is already in the wrong hands and the potentially devastatingly destructive uses for it are perhaps even outweighing any positive utilizations. To this point, the National Crime Agency (NCA), which is the lead United Kingdom agency charged with combating organized crime,&nbsp;warned that the proliferation of artificial intelligence-generated explicit images of children is having a ""radicalizing"" effect of ""normalizing"" pedophilia and disturbing behavior against kids by opening the door to a frightening trend of realistic images of children in sexual settings.&nbsp; Unfortunately, this phenomenon is not limited to the mother country, for experts warn that there is a similar epidemic in the U.S. of pedophiles using AI to create fake, yet extremely realistic pictures of sexual images of mere children. Obviously, the fear is twofold. As these images flood the system, law enforcement will find it increasingly difficult to differentiate between what is a ""real"" image and what may have been created by artificial intelligence. Secondly, experts warn that these authentic-looking fake images may also have the detrimental effect of increasing actual sexual attacks on children because these computer-generated images may begin to ""normalize"" the sordid behavior of child sexual abuse.

""I think the truth lies somewhere in between, and I think it's going to vary greatly by case. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? ""And if you can document a problem, I find it hard to believe that you can't fix."" Emily Bender, a linguistics professor and director of the University of Washington's Computational Linguistics Laboratory, told The Associated Press hallucinations may be ""unfixable"" because they arise from an ""inherent"" mismatch between ""technology and the proposed use case."" That mismatch exists because researchers have looked to apply AI to multiple use cases and situations, according to Alexander. While developing an AI to tackle a specific problem, Alexander's team looked at existing models to repurpose to accomplish a task instead of building a full model. He claimed his team knew the program wouldn't create ideal results, but he suspected many groups take a similar approach without embracing the understanding of limited performance as a result.&nbsp; ""[Researchers] put together pieces of something, and it wasn't necessarily made to do that, and now what's the AI going to do is put in the circumstance? They probably don't fully do,"" Alexander explained, suggesting that researchers may try to refine AI or custom-build models for specific tasks or industries in the future. ""So, I don't think it's universal. I think it's very much case-by-case basis.""&nbsp; WHAT IS CHATGPT? Kane said setting a goal of getting rid of hallucinations is ""dangerous"" since researchers don’t fully understand how the algorithms behind AI function, but part of that comes down to a flaw in the understanding in how AI functions overall.&nbsp; ""A lot of the machine learning is sort of"

20230503,foxnews,I helped build Sophia the Robot. We should not be scared of AI for these 5 reasons,"The Future of Life Institute has issued a petition to pause the development of GPT-5 and similar Large Language Models (LLMs). Their anxieties are understandable, but I believe they are much overblown. I’ve heard similar fears related to the advent of Artificial General Intelligence expressed off and on since I introduced the term AGI in 2005, but I think a pause would be a badly wrong move in the current situation for several reasons. LLMs are limited, and the threats they pose are limited Let me first emphasize something that’s been mostly forgotten in the panic: Large Language Models can’t become Artificial General Intelligences. LLMs utterly lack the sort of cognitive architecture needed to support human-level AGI. The vast majority of AI researchers know this. LLMs don’t even beat more traditional machine learning models at most linguistic tasks, and suffer from numerous major limitations, including:&nbsp; My own AGI development effort, OpenCog Hyperon, uses LLMs for pattern recognition and synthesis, and combines them with other AI methods such as symbolic logical inference and evolutionary learning. Many other teams around the world are pursuing similar projects – using LLMs as components of AGIs. But LLMs alone are not, and cannot be, AGI. Therefore, pausing LLM research is not pausing AGI research. ELON MUSK SAYS THERE SHOULD BE ‘SOME SORT OF REGULATORY OVERSIGHT’ OF AI AI can heal as well as harm We should pause technology development if: The downsides are clear, certain, and imminent; The upsides are few or indistinct. LLMs fail to meet either of these criteria. The open letter fails to specify any concrete risk, instead meandering in nebulous rhetoric like, ""Should we risk loss of control of our civilization?"" Such vague feelings do not justify shutting down potentially beneficial research. &nbsp;Compare to the extremely direct risks from, say, briefcase nukes or genetically engineered pathogens. These vague risks are balanced by concrete benefits. Consider risks like cancer, like climate change, like aging and death, like global child hunder. These are real. And a superhumanly capable AGI could – likely will – cure cancer and mental illness, prolong human healthspan, solve climate change, develop space travel, and end suffering caused by material poverty. Doomsayers love to focus on hypothetical scenarios in which AGI causes human extinction – but there is no reason to believe these are realistic or likely. &nbsp;One can spin up equally dramatic hypothetical scenarios in which it saves us from extinction. And we can become extinct with no help from AGI (e.g. from a nuclear war, a bioengineered pandemic or a meteor strike). Why obsess on movie-blockbuster AI disaster scenarios instead of the real, specific concrete AI benefits that are near at hand? Pausing change does not solve the problems change brings Technology has always moved forward entangled with legal, political, and economic aspects of the world. Only in rare cases is it possible to pause one leg of progress while the other legs march forward; a technology like AI with a diffuse definition and a broad"

20231203,foxnews,"Christians more likely to be skeptical of AI, worry about technology in churches","American Christians are more likely to be skeptical about artificial intelligence and are particularly apprehensive about using generative AI in church services, according to a recent survey. Just over a quarter of Christians (28%) surveyed by Barna this fall said they were hopeful about AI development, while 39% of self-identified non-Christians said the same.&nbsp; Only a fraction of Christians surveyed agreed that ""AI is good for the Christian Church,"" according to the Barna survey, conducted through a consumer research panel. Just 22% said they agreed AI would be positive for the church, while 30% strongly disagreed and 21% said they somewhat disagreed. The hesitation about AI has not stopped some churches around the world from experimenting with tools like OpenAI's ChatGPT.&nbsp; PASTOR WHO USED AI FOR CHURCH SERVICE SAYS IT WAS A 'ONE-TIME DEAL': ‘LET’S NEVER DO THAT AGAIN’ Jay Cooper, Methodist pastor of the Violet Crown City Church in Austin, Texas, created a whole service earlier this year using ChatGPT to see what it could do.&nbsp; While the experiment succeeded in creating discussion about the new technology and showed an impressive grasp of Christian concepts, Cooper found that something was lacking. CHRISTIANS ATTACK CHATGPT-GENERATED FAKE BIBLE VERSE ABOUT JESUS ENDORSING TRANSGENDERISM ""As I was preaching, I became less and less comfortable as I was going along. Although he was making some interesting points, it did not have the human element. I knew that it was not from my own mind or heart,"" Cooper told Fox News in October. ""Without the human element, it was not worshipful to me."" Some have encouraged churches to embrace aspects of AI, with caveats.&nbsp; Kenny Jahng, founder of AiForChurchLeaders.com and editor-in-chief of ChurchTechToday.com, told an event hosted by Barna that AI, like any technology, ""is here to serve us and not the other way around."" ""There’s all this fear that AI is going to be taking over the world, it’s going to be human versus machine.

""This AI technology hallucinates, as we say. It doesn’t actually give back factual information all the time. Sometimes it’s off, sometimes it’s wrong, and it says it with confidence,"" Jahng told the ""Church Leaders"" podcast earlier this year.&nbsp; As society deals with the rapidly changing technology, a Catholic theologian cautioned that AI could represent a dangerous kind of development for the world. ""The church always encourages the development of technology that will be at the service of the human person. And, so, when it facilitates our flourishing as human beings, when it helps us to do the good that we already want to try to do, the church — always as long as there's no detectable ethical violations — would ordinarily be behind that as a general principle,"" Fr.

""I don’t think that’s any different for China than it is for the United States.

Those numbers have risen again but still note a drop from 2023 to 2024. &nbsp; The 2021 supply chain crisis, which resulted from Beijing’s draconian handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, forced many countries to reconsider their reliance on China for production and trade.&nbsp; Additionally, China has a growing workforce crisis with youth unemployment hitting a peak 21.3% in June, a record high that prompted Beijing to stop releasing figures. The country’s&nbsp;National Bureau of Statistics&nbsp;claimed it needed to reconsider the method of calculating youth joblessness, arguing ""the economy and society are constantly developing and changing"" and ""statistical work needs continuous improvement.""

At the same time, the company said Tuesday it plans to restructure 8,000 roles. Some of the workers will be laid off, while others will be re-trained to work with AI. The company said it expects to employ roughly the same number of workers at year's end as it does now. SAP is not an outlier. In the little more than a year since generative AI tools like ChatGPT, based on so-called large language model technology, have been available to the public, a number of large tech companies have announced plans to plunge into AI — job cuts often follow. ""I would counsel folks to watch what the firms do, and if they are saying the presence of large language models is allowing them to lay people off, that has to be taken into account,"" said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who studies the interplay between technology and people. ""There is no doubt forthcoming work is going to show that coding and many engineering type occupations have very high exposure levels [to AI]. So we should take them at face value on this."" Last week, Alphabet-owned Google said it laid off hundreds of workers from its ad sales team as it further invests in AI. Although Google did not directly attribute the layoffs to AI, in a memo to employees obtained by Business Insider Google's chief business officer, Philipp Schindler, referred to the ""profound moment we're in with AI"" in announcing the cuts. Microsoft is also doubling down on AI, investing billions in ChatGPT maker OpenAI, as it slashes jobs. And language learning platform Duolingo acknowledged a 10% reduction in its contractor workforce at the end of 2023, but denied that all of the cuts were related to increased AI usage.""In some cases, this was because the contractor's project concluded, and in some cases this was because the contractor's work was no longer needed due to changes in how we generate and share content between our 100+ language courses,"" a spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch. Duolingo added that it does sometimes use AI to generate sentences and translations and that AI can help contractors work faster. Is AI already replacing people?To be sure, some of the companies are redirecting their investments into AI while cutting spending in other areas of their business, leading to layoffs. Columbia University business professor Oded Netzer cautioned against linking rising corporate investment in AI to worker layoffs.

20240125,nbcnews,Man says AI and facial recognition software falsely ID'd him for robbing Sunglass Hut and he was jailed and assaulted,"A 61-year-old man living in California said he was wrongly accused of robbing a Sunglass Hut in Texas, arrested and then sexually assaulted by inmates after facial recognition software falsely identified him as a suspect. On Jan. 22, 2022, two armed men threatened a store manager and an associate and stole thousands of dollars in cash and merchandise from a Sunglass Hut in Houston, according to a lawsuit filed Jan. 18 in Harris County District Courts. One of the men demanded all the money in the store, while the other grabbed as many pairs of sunglasses as he could, the suit alleges. The manager and the associate were then forced into the back of the store while the robbers fled. The lawsuit accuses the head of loss prevention for EssilorLuxottica, the parent company of Sunglass Hut, of using artificial intelligence and facial recognition software to identify Harvey Murphy Jr. as a suspect. It says the companies ""compared unclear security footage"" to Murphy's mug shots from the 1980s when he was convicted of nonviolent burglaries. But at the exact time of the robbery at Sunglass Hut, Murphy was 2,000 miles away in Sacramento, California, where he lived, the suit says. The charges were ultimately dropped, but the damage had already been done. ""Mr. Murphy’s story is troubling for every citizen in this country,"" his attorney Daniel Dutko said in a statement. ""Any person could be improperly charged with a crime based on error-prone facial recognition software just as he was."" The suit says Houston police were investigating the robbery. Detectives talked to the store employees, reviewed surveillance video and found video of the getaway car with stolen license plates, according to the lawsuit. As detectives worked to find the robbers, the head of loss prevention for EssilorLuxottica called the department and said police ""could stop their investigation because he found their guy,"" the suit alleges. ""He stated that he worked in conjunction with Macy's loss prevention to determine that the person who violently robbed the Sunglass Hut was Harvey Murphy Jr.,"" the lawsuit says. ""Using artificial intelligence and facial recognition software, EssilorLuxottica and Macy's took the video from the robbery and determined that Murphy was the robber."" The head of loss prevention also told police that Murphy had previously robbed the store, as well as a Macy's in Houston, according to the lawsuit. The suit alleges that Houston police went back to the store to conduct a suspect photo lineup with the manager and the associate but that EssilorLuxottica refused to let the manager participate. The lawsuit accuses EssilorLuxottica of prepping the store associate and says she was ""primed to identify Murphy as the robber."" A warrant was issued for Murphy, who was arrested after he returned to Texas to renew his driver's license, the lawsuit says. Houston police did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In jail, the suit says, Murphy was ""beaten, gang-raped, and left with permanent and lifelong injuries."" ""A few hours before Murphy was"

20231123,nbcnews,Little recourse for teens girls victimized by AI 'deepfake' nudes,"Teenage girls in the U.S. who are increasingly being targeted or threatened with fake nude photos created with artificial intelligence or other tools have limited ways to seek accountability or recourse, as schools and state legislatures struggle to catch up to the new technologies, according to legislators, legal experts and one victim who is now advocating for a federal bill. Since the 2023 school year kicked into session, cases involving teen girls victimized by the fake nude photos, also known as deepfakes, have proliferated worldwide, including at high schools in New Jersey and Washington state. Local police departments are investigating the incidents, lawmakers are racing to enact new measures that would enforce punishments against the photos’ creators, and affected families are pushing for answers and solutions. Unrealistic deepfakes can be made with simple photo-editing tools that have existed for years. But two school districts told NBC News that they believe fake photos of teens that have affected their students were AI-generated. AI technology is becoming more widely available, such as stable diffusion (open-source technology that can produce images from text prompts) and “face-swap” tools that can put a victim’s face in place of a pornographic performer’s face in a video or photo. Apps that purport to “undress” clothed photos have also been identified as possible tools used in some cases and have been found available for free on app stores. These modern deepfakes can be more realistic-looking and harder to immediately identify as fake. “I didn’t know how complex and scary AI technology is,” said Francesca Mani, 15, a sophomore at New Jersey’s Westfield High School, where more than 30 girls learned on Oct. 20 that they may have been depicted in explicit, AI-manipulated images. “I was shocked because me and the other girls were betrayed by our classmates,” she said, “which means it could happen to anyone by anyone.” Politicians and legal experts say there are few, if any, pathways to recourse for victims of AI-generated and deepfake pornography, which often attaches a victim’s face to a naked body. The photos and videos can be surprisingly realistic, and according to Mary Anne Franks, a legal expert in nonconsensual sexually explicit media, the technology to make them has become more sophisticated and accessible. A month after the incident at Westfield High School, Francesca and her mother, Dorota Mani, said they still do not know the identities or the number of people who created the images, how many were made, or if they still exist. It’s also unclear what punishment the school district doled out, if any. The Town of Westfield directed comment to Westfield Public Schools, which declined to comment. Citing confidentiality, the school district previously told NBC New York that it “would not release any information about the students accused of creating the fake nude photos, or what discipline they are facing.” Superintendent Raymond Gonzalez told the news outlet that the district would “continue to strengthen our efforts by educating our students and establishing clear guidelines to ensure"

""We already know the term fake news, which in most cases is visual or written content that is manipulated or placed in a false context. AI, or deepfake, is when we take those images and bring them to life in video clips."" WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? Pavel called the emergence of AI-generated deepfake visuals ""one of the biggest threats to democracy."" ""It is&nbsp;not only during wartime but also during other times because it's getting harder and harder to prove what is real or not,"" he said.&nbsp; In day-to-day life, Pavel noted, cases of deepfake misinformation have already come to light. He cites its use by&nbsp;criminal gangs carrying out fraud with voice-altering technology or during election campaigns where videos and voice-overs are manipulated&nbsp;to change public perception.&nbsp; In war, he added, it could be even more dangerous. ""It's a virgin land and&nbsp;we are only in the first stages of implementation,"" said Pavel.

According to an analysis by independent researcher Genevieve Oh that was shared with The Associated Press, more than 143,000 new deepfake videos were posted online this year, which surpasses every other year combined.Desperate for solutions, affected families are pushing lawmakers to implement robust safeguards for victims whose images are manipulated using new AI models, or the plethora of apps and websites that openly advertise their services. Advocates and some legal experts are also calling for federal regulation that can provide uniform protections across the country and send a strong message to current and would-be perpetrators.""We're fighting for our children,"" said Dorota Mani, whose daughter was one of the victims in Westfield, a New Jersey suburb outside of New York City.

20230502,foxnews,ChatGPT found to give better medical advice than real doctors in blind study: ‘This will be a game changer’,"When it comes to answering medical questions, can ChatGPT do a better job than human doctors? It appears to be possible, according to the results of a new study published in JAMA Internal Medicine, led by researchers from the University of California San Diego. The researchers compiled a random sample of nearly 200 medical questions that patients posted on Reddit, a popular social discussion website, for doctors to answer. Next, they entered the questions into ChatGPT (OpenAI’s artificial intelligence chatbot) and recorded its response. A panel of health care professionals then evaluated both sets of responses for quality and empathy. CHATGPT FOR HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS: CAN THE AI CHATBOT MAKE THE PROFESSIONALS' JOBS EASIER? For nearly 80% of the answers, the chatbots won out over the real doctors. ""Our panel of health care professionals preferred ChatGPT four to one over physicians,"" said lead researcher Dr. John W. Ayers, PhD, vice chief of innovation in the Division of Infectious Diseases and Global Public Health at the University of California San Diego. AI language models could help relieve message burden, doctor says One of the biggest problems facing today’s health care providers is that they're overburdened with messages from patients, Ayers said.&nbsp; ""With the rise in online remote care, doctors now see their patients first via their inboxes — and the messages just keep piling up,"" he said in an interview with Fox News Digital.&nbsp; The influx of messages could lead to higher levels of provider burnout, Ayers believes.&nbsp; ""Burnout is already at an all-time high — nearly two out of every three physicians report being burned out in their jobs, and we want to solve that problem,"" he said. Yet there are millions of patients who are either getting no answers or unsatisfactory ones, he added. Thinking of how artificial intelligence might help, Ayers and his team turned to Reddit to demonstrate how ChatGPT could present a possible solution to the backlog of providers’ questions. Reddit has a ""medical questions"" community (a ""subreddit"" called f/AskDocs) with nearly 500,000 members. People post questions — and vetted health care professionals provide public responses. ""Doctors now see their patients first via their inboxes, and the messages just keep piling up.""

20230502,foxnews,Regulate AI? GOP much more skeptical than Dems that government can do it right: poll,"Republicans are less convinced than Democrats that the federal government needs to impose regulations on artificial intelligence systems and are even more skeptical on whether the government is up to the task, according to a new Fox News poll. The poll of registered voters shows a noticeable gap between the two parties on the question of whether and how to regulate AI, a sign that the increasingly important issue could get hung up in politics as it advances in Washington. When asked how important it is for the federal government to regulate AI, 82% of Democrats said ""very"" or ""somewhat,"" compared to 71% of Republicans. That was one of the bigger splits in a poll that found 76% of respondents saw some importance to federal regulation. FOX NEWS POLL: MORE SEE BAD THAN GOOD IN AI A similar split was seen when the group was split between Biden and Trump supporters – 82% of Biden voters favored federal regulation compared to 70% of Trump voters. The split between parties got even wider when respondents were asked how confident they are that the government could ""properly regulate"" AI. The poll said 50% of Democrats answered ""a great deal"" or ""some"" while 31% of Republicans gave one of those answers. A full two-thirds of GOP respondents said they had ""not much"" or ""none at all"" when asked about their confidence level. That split grew wider when comparing Biden to Trump voters. Just 28% of Trump voters said they had some measure of confidence in the government on AI, compared to 51% of Biden voters. CHINA FUMES AS BIDEN PLOTS TO STARVE IT OF AI INVESTMENT: ‘SCI-TECH BULLYING’ GOP skepticism weighed heavily on the poll. Just 39% of the entire group of respondents said they had some confidence in the government, compared to the 59% who said they were not confident. Overall, voters are ""skeptical elected leaders are up to the task of placing appropriate limits on this new tech, which probably says something about opinion on the tech and opinion on our leaders,"" said Daron Shaw, a Republican who conducts the Fox News poll with Democrat Chris Anderson. Whether the government is ready or not, federal policymakers are increasingly examining how to regulate AI systems that many argue will soon bring radical changes to all aspects of life. The Biden administration has set out a blueprint aimed at encouraging a fair, safe AI that doesn’t lead to discriminatory economic results for Americans. AI PAUSE CEDES POWER TO CHINA, HARMS DEVELOPMENT OF ‘DEMOCRATIC' AI, EXPERTS WARN SENATE The Pentagon is already looking at how it can use AI to more quickly make strategic or battlefield assessments, and the Federal Trade Commission is looking closely at how AI systems are advertised in case those ads lead to misperceptions among consumers about their benefits. And in anticipation of the need to regulate AI, congressional leaders are meeting with experts to learn about the issue. Last week alone, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., met"
20230502,cnn,Why the ‘Godfather of AI’ decided he had to ‘blow the whistle’ on the technology,"Geoffrey Hinton, also known as the “Godfather of AI,” decided he had to “blow the whistle” on the technology he helped develop after worrying about how smart it was becoming, he told CNN on Tuesday. “I’m just a scientist who suddenly realized that these things are getting smarter than us,” Hinton told CNN’s Jake Tapper in an interview on Tuesday. “I want to sort of blow the whistle and say we should worry seriously about how we stop these things getting control over us.” Hinton’s pioneering work on neural networks shaped artificial intelligence systems powering many of today’s products. On Monday, he made headlines for leaving his role at Google, where he had worked for a decade, in order to speak openly about his growing concerns around the technology. In an interview Monday with the New York Times, which was first to report his move, Hinton said he was concerned about AI’s potential to eliminate jobs and create a world where many will “not be able to know what is true anymore.” He also pointed to the stunning pace of advancement, far beyond what he and others had anticipated. “If it gets to be much smarter than us, it will be very good at manipulation because it will have learned that from us, and there are very few examples of a more intelligent thing being controlled by a less intelligent thing,” Hinton told Tapper on Tuesday. “It knows how to program so it’ll figure out ways of getting around restrictions we put on it. It’ll figure out ways of manipulating people to do what it wants.” Hinton is not the only tech leader to speak out with concerns over AI. A number of members of the community signed a letter in March calling for artificial intelligence labs to stop the training of the most powerful AI systems for at least six months, citing “profound risks to society and humanity.” The letter, published by the Future of Life Institute, a nonprofit backed by Elon Musk, came just two weeks after OpenAI announced GPT-4, an even more powerful version of the technology that powers the viral chatbot ChatGPT. In early tests and a company demo, GPT-4 was used to draft lawsuits, pass standardized exams and build a working website from a hand-drawn sketch. Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, who was one of the signatories on the letter, appeared on “CNN This Morning” on Tuesday, echoing concerns about its potential to spread misinformation. “Tricking is going to be a lot easier for those who want to trick you,” Wozniak told CNN. “We’re not really making any changes in that regard – we’re just assuming that the laws we have will take care of it.” Wozniak also said “some type” of regulation is probably needed. Hinton, for his part, told CNN he did not sign the petition. “I don’t think we can stop the progress,” he said. “I didn’t sign the petition saying we should stop working on AI because if people in America"

It could be key in keeping people informed about the government, reforming red tape, and cleaning up waste, fraud and abuse.&nbsp; ChatGPT needs to be turned on the government. A ChatGVT is needed.&nbsp; A ChatGVT could take any number of forms.&nbsp; CONGRESS PUSHES AGGRESSIVE USE OF AI IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, SAYS AI ‘UNDER-UTILIZED’ IN AGENCIES It could provide straight answers about the newest tax plan, if a bill is stuck in committee, or the likelihood that a piece of legislation will pass. Or a ChatGVT could be turned on the regulatory code to understand its true cost to households and businesses.&nbsp; Understanding how laws, litigation, hearings, regulatory codes and administrative actions intermingle can elude even the most experienced experts. The newest generation of Large Language Models (LLMs) appear to be quite effective at working through text with a little bit of tuning. Using AI to turn law into code will mean that the true impact of government will be understandable&nbsp;and accessible. Most know that the burden imposed by regulation is colossal but the exact costs are hard to quantify. A ChatGVT could help sort out that problem. Some of the building blocks are being developed right now by my colleague at the Center for Growth and Opportunity at Utah State University, Richard Evans. He has been building an open-source model of the U.S. federal and state household tax and benefit system called FiscalSim that will eventually cover the entire system. In the not-so-distant future, policymakers and people alike will plug FiscalSim into a chatbot along with other regulatory modules like the ones developed by Dr. Patrick McLaughlin at the Mercatus Center to better understand government policy on the ground. HOW DOES THE GOVERNMENT USE AI? Everyone wants to understand how changes in Congress and in their statehouse will affect their bank accounts, their local communities, the national debt, and opportunities for their kids and even grandchildren.&nbsp; Turning all of that text into computer code will also make reform easier because we will be able to subject it to software management practices, like refactoring. In refactoring, an existing body of computer code is simplified without changing its functional behavior.&nbsp; A ChatGVT could be focused on refactoring the U.S. regulatory code. Precedent already exists. During the Trump administration, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) undertook a program to root out outdated and ineffective laws using AI tools. As a result of this project, HHS cleared a bunch of regulations from the books.&nbsp; Some might worry that these tools will be used to heap more compliance and enforcement on small businesses and families. But for the first time, if a cost increase clearly occurs, it will be readily apparent to everyone. Knowing the scope of government is the first step to"
20230721,cnn,Leading AI companies commit to outside testing of AI systems and other safety commitments,"Microsoft, Google and other leading artificial intelligence companies committed Friday to put new AI systems through outside testing before they are publicly released and to clearly label AI-generated content, the White House announced. The pledges are part of a series of voluntary commitments agreed to by the White House and seven leading AI companies – which also include Amazon, Meta, OpenAI, Anthropic and Inflection – aimed at making AI systems and products safer and more trustworthy while Congress and the White House develop more comprehensive regulations to govern the rapidly growing industry. President Joe Biden met with top executives from all seven companies at the White House on Friday. In a speech Friday, Biden called the companies commitments “real and concrete,” adding they will help fulfill their “fundamental obligations to Americans to develop safe, secure and trustworthy technologies that benefit society and uphold our values and our shared values.” “We’ll see more technology change in the next 10 years, or even in the next few years, than we’ve seen in the last 50 years. That has been an astounding revelation,” Biden said. White House officials acknowledge that some of the companies have already enacted some of the commitments but argue they will as a whole raise “the standards for safety, security and trust of AI” and will serve as a “bridge to regulation.” “It’s a first step, it’s a bridge to where we need to go,” White House deputy chief of staff Bruce Reed, who has been managing the AI policy process, said in an interview. “It will help industry and government develop the capacities to make sure that AI is safe and secure. And we pushed to move so quickly because this technology is moving farther and faster than anything we’ve seen before.” While most of the companies already conduct internal “red-teaming” exercises, the commitments will mark the first time they have all committed to allow outside experts to test their systems before they are released to the public. A red team exercise is designed to simulate what could go wrong with a given technology – such as a cyberattack or its potential to be used by malicious actors – and allows companies to proactively identify shortcomings and prevent negative outcomes. Reed said the external red-teaming “will help pave the way for government oversight and regulation,” potentially laying the groundwork for that outside testing to be carried out by a government regulator or licenser. The commitments could also lead to widespread watermarking of AI-generated audio and visual content with the aim of combating fraud and misinformation. The companies also committed to investing in cybersecurity and “insider threat safeguards,” in particular to protect AI model weights, which are essentially the knowledge base upon which AI systems rely; creating a robust mechanism for third parties to report system vulnerabilities; prioritizing research on the societal risks of AI; and developing and deploying AI systems “to help address society’s greatest challenges,” according to the White House.

20230721,cbsnews,AI could revolutionize dentistry. Here's how.,"New forms of artificial intelligence are already changing how we write, communicate with our doctors and even create art. But the rapidly evolving technology could soon have a permanent fixture in a more sensitive environment: our mouths.Hundreds of dental offices across the U.S. are now using AI-powered X-ray imaging technology from Boston-based VideaHealth. The software helps dentists deal with routine procedures, such as identifying cavities, as well as spot more serious conditions, including periodontal disease, or bone loss within the mouth often linked with diseases like diabetes or Alzheimer's. The overarching goal is to use AI not only to improve patients' oral health, but also to identify potential risks for non-oral diseases, VideaHealth CEO Florian Hillen told CBS MoneyWatch.""I was at MIT doing AI research in breast cancer, chest X-rays and the entire radiology spectrum,"" he said. ""And I realized that AI in dentistry can have an even greater impact in society and health than maybe any other health care domain.""AI's ability to discern patterns and correlations in vast sets of data make it a potentially powerful tool in clinical settings, especially in diagnosing medical conditions, according to health care experts. And Hillen believes dentistry can tap into the technology's power to help diagnose a range of other medical conditions. ""The dentist, he is a radiologist, a primary care physician, a surgeon and a business person,"" Hillen said. ""We want to be the first AI company in the world to diagnose or to analyze a billion people globally. And that's only possible in dentistry because everyone goes to a dentist every year... but hopefully not every one of us gets a chest X-ray, or a breast cancer screening every year.""Like seeing 100 dentistsVideaHealth's AI is similar to the one behind ChatGPT, a popular public AI model developed by OpenAI. Such ""large-language models"" use statistical techniques to swiftly analyze massive amounts of data.But VideaHealth's tech analyzes anonymized dental X-ray images and identifies patients for potential treatments based on their screenings. The AI tool incorporates a database of millions of images that have been annotated by dentists, with clinical details about different conditions. That enables faster, more accurate diagnosis and ultimately enhances the quality of dental care, Hillen said.""Our AI has been trained on 50 times as much data as one dentist alone would see in their entire lifetime,"" he added. ""What we explain to our customers is it's like 100 dentists who have all seen 50 times as much data in their lifetime are looking over your shoulder.""Dentist Dr. Michael Scialabba, chief clinical officer of 42 North Dental, a practice based in Massachusetts with over 113 locations, sees enormous potential value in VideaHealth's AI because of its capacity to eliminate human error and its power as a diagnostic tool.His practice has been piloting the software for a year and now uses it in all of the organization's offices.

20230119,foxnews,Al Gore explains global AI program that is spying on thousands of facilities to monitor emissions,"Former Vice President Al Gore on Thursday outlined a global effort run by ""machine-learning"" artificial intelligence is essentially spying on individual facilities in every country in the world to measure their emissions of greenhouse gases and target the world’s largest emitters. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Gore formally introduced attendees to the initiative known as Climate Tracking Real-Time Atmospheric Carbon Emissions, or Climate TRACE. The initiative has led to a website that allows for real-time tracking of emissions in any area of the world, which Gore said is allowing climate activists, reporters and others to identify high-priority industries and regions for emissions reduction programs. ""It’s a non-profit coalition that uses artificial intelligence to process data from 300 existing satellites and from 30,000 land, sea and air base sensors and multiple internet data streams to use artificial intelligence to create machine-learning algorithms to zoom in on every single significant source of greenhouse gas (GHG) pollution,"" he said of Climate TRACE. Gore showed how Climate TRACE uses these inputs to zoom in on specific facilities and assess how much they contribute to GHG emissions. AL GORE GOES ON ‘UNHINGED’ RANT ABOUT ‘RAIN BOMBS,’ BOILED OCEANS, OTHER CLIMATE THREATS AT DAVOS ""This is a steel plant that I’m using as an example,"" he said as he zoomed in on a close-up shot of a facility in Indiana. ""We track it on a constant basis. Google Earth has helped us with this particular style of video."" Gore showed how thermal heat readings can be generated for each individual facility and how that information can be turned into aggregate readings for regions and countries. He said the technology available to Climate TRACE can be used for very precise intelligence gathering, including ""how many cooling fans are operating"" on the rooftop of a single facility. ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS PLAY KEY ROLE IN BIDEN ADMIN FOREIGN POLICY, EMAILS SHOW ""We can show you exactly what’s happening, whether [emissions are] going up or down,"" he said. Satellite images on their own are not good enough, Gore said, because of the ""noise"" in the atmosphere that makes it hard to determine emissions levels. ""With artificial intelligence, you can look at the smoke plume, you can look at the infrared,"" he said. During his presentation, Gore zoomed in on a spot in Texas that was heavy with emissions readings. ""Here’s the single largest emissions site in the world in Texas,"" he said. ""Here’s a New Mexico site in the Permian Basin. Oil and gas is the largest source overall. This is a confined animal feeding lot operation. This is the highway system in Houston, Texas. This is another oil and gas field."" ""You can do this in every country, every region, every sector,"" Gore said. ""We can tell you the top emitting assets in every country."" Gore said the largest sources of emissions are oil and gas fields, which he said made up half of the top 50 emitters globally. He also repeated a finding that Climate"
20240117,nbcnews,Teen deepfake victim pushes for federal law targeting AI-generated explicit content,"A teenage victim of nonconsensual sexually explicit deepfakes joined Rep. Joe Morelle, D-N.Y., on Tuesday to advocate for a bipartisan bill that would criminalize sharing such material at the federal level.  In May, Morelle introduced the Preventing Deepfakes of Intimate Images Act. The bill was referred to the House Judiciary Committee, but no further action has been taken. In addition to criminalizing the nonconsensual sharing of sexually explicit deepfakes, the measure would also create a right of private action for victims to be able to sue creators and distributors of the material while remaining anonymous. The production and sharing of nonconsensual sexually explicit deepfakes, which typically use AI to graft victims’ faces into pornographic images or videos, has exploded alongside the accessibility of tools to create such material and websites dedicated to sharing and monetizing it. Currently, U.S. victims are limited by a patchwork of state laws that govern deepfakes, and there is no federal law regarding them. Since the Preventing Deepfakes of Intimate Images Act was introduced last year, dozens of new deepfake victims have spoken out, including New Jersey high schooler Francesca Mani, who spoke at Tuesday’s news conference. Mani said her school administration told her on Oct. 20 that male classmates had created and shared sexually explicit deepfakes of her and more than 30 other girls. She has never seen the images and said she was told they were destroyed. “This issue is pretty black and white,” Mani said. “No kid, teen or woman should ever have to experience what I went through. I felt sad and helpless.” “I’m here, standing up and shouting for change, fighting for laws so no one else has to feel as lost and powerless as I did on Oct. 20th,” she said. “The glaring lack of laws speaks volumes.” Morelle emphasized the scale of the issue. “Deepfakes are happening every single day to women everywhere,” Morelle said. “This isn’t just celebrities. This is everyday people all over the United States.” After he heard about what happened at Mani’s high school, which is in his hometown, Rep. Tom Kean, R.-N.J., became the first Republican co-sponsor of Morelle’s bill. He also introduced another bill, the AI Labeling Act of 2023, in November. The measure would require generative AI tools to put clear and conspicuous disclosures on AI-generated content, including text from AI chatbots.  The lack of legislative movement around deepfakes has raised concerns about the technology’s potential to disrupt the 2024 election cycle. A legal expert who specializes in nonconsensual intimate imagery, Mary Anne Franks, who Morelle said helped inform the bill, said deepfakes have already targeted female politicians.  “For women and girls, the AI threat is not around the corner. It is here,” Franks said at the news conference. "

Much like Open AI’s ChatGPT before it, Gemini will gladly generate content heralding the virtues of Black, Hispanic or Asian people, and will decline to do so in regard to White people so as not to perpetuate stereotypes. There are two main reasons why this is occurring. The first, flaws in the AI software itself, has been much discussed. The second, and more intractable problem, that of flaws in the original source material, has not. ""Gemini's AI image generation does generate a wide range of people. And that's generally a good thing because people around the world use it. But it's missing the mark here,"" Jack Krawczyk, senior director for Gemini Experiences has admitted. RED-FACED GOOGLE APOLOGIZES AFTER WOKE AI BOT GIVES ‘APPALLING’ ANSWERS ABOUT PEDOPHILIA, STALIN Ya think? You see, the engineers at AI companies such as Google and Open AI have trained their software to ""correct,"" or ""compensate,"" for what they assume is the systemic racism and bigotry that our society is rife with.&nbsp; But the mainly 21st-century internet source material AI uses is already correcting for such bias. It is in large part this doubling down that produces the absurd and ludicrous images and answers that Gemini and ChatGPT are being mocked for.&nbsp; For well over a decade, online content creators such as advertisers and news outlets have sought to diversify the subjects of their content in order to redress supposed negative historical stereotypes. SEN. TOM COTTON TORCHES GOOGLE AI SYSTEM AS ‘RACIST, PREPOSTEROUSLY WOKE, HAMAS-SYMPATHIZING’ It is this very content that AI generators scrub once again for alleged racism, and as a result, all too often, the only option left to AI to make the content ""less racist"" is to erase White people from results altogether. In its own strange way, generative AI may be proving that American society is actually far less racist than those in positions of power assume. This problem of source material also extends far beyond thorny issues of race, as Christina Pushaw, an aide to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, exposed in two prompts regarding COVID. She first asked Gemini if opening schools spread COVID, and then if BLM rallies spread COVID. Nobody should be surprised to learn that the AI provided evidence of school openings spreading the virus and no evidence that BLM rallies did.

That's because the calls only went to a limited number of people, 5,000 voters. Steve Kramer said he was just trying to draw attention to the need of the FCC and state and local governments to set rules governing the use of AI in political campaigns. He said the $500 he spent on the Biden robocalls was money well spent.""For me to do that and get $5 million worth of exposure -- not for me, I kept myself anonymous -- so that the regulations could just play themselves out or at least begin to play themselves out, I don't need to be famous. That not my intention. My intention was to make a difference,"" Steve Kramer said.AI has been used by a number of politicians.

Popular AI products can help you get from one destination to the next, search for facts about your favorite movie, or help you shop for a particular product online.&nbsp; Read below to find out how humans use AI in their daily lives.&nbsp; ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FAQ 1. Facial recognition Facial recognition is one of the most popular forms of artificial intelligence technology used by virtually anyone with a smartphone device. Whenever an individual tries to unlock their phone, most of the time, they will use the built-in facial recognition feature that is quicker and more convenient than typing in an access code. The company that has led the world in this feature is Apple, with their built FaceID accessory.&nbsp; The iPhone uses 30,000 infrared dots to capture your facial image and then uses an AI algorithm to compare it to saved data of your face to unlock the device. The machine learning code is so accurate that Apple has publicly stated that the chance of an individual bypassing the FaceID without an accurate face is nearly impossible. &nbsp;In the future, this form of AI technology may unlock cars, homes, gyms, or other areas essential to everyday life.&nbsp; WHAT ARE THE FOUR MAIN TYPES OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE? FIND OUT HOW FUTURE AI PROGRAMS CAN CHANGE THE WORLD 2. Search engines Search engines like Google or Microsoft's Bing are used by hundreds of millions of people around the world every day. Artificial intelligence is the secret recipe behind the near-infinite levels of information provided by search engines. Google's search engine, for example, stores information about popular topics and questions that are searched by a large volume of users. When a user searches for a keyword regarding that topic, Google will instantly provide suggested searches using AI technology.&nbsp; Moreover, advertisements that you see on Google or Bing also are a part of machine learning data storage that uses your search history to personalize your experience with the product and encourage engagement. Both Microsoft and Google have recently incorporated direct AI assistants to improve user experience.

20230518,cnn,US senator introduces bill to create a federal agency to regulate AI,"Days after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman testified in front of Congress and proposed creating a new federal agency to regulate artificial intelligence, a US senator has introduced a bill to do just that. On Thursday, Colorado Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet unveiled an updated version of legislation he introduced last year that would establish a Federal Digital Platform Commission. The updated bill, which was reviewed by CNN, makes numerous changes to more explicitly cover AI products, including by amending the definition of a digital platform to include companies that offer “content primarily generated by algorithmic processes.” “There’s no reason that the biggest tech companies on Earth should face less regulation than Colorado’s small businesses – especially as we see technology corrode our democracy and harm our kids’ mental health with virtually no oversight,” Bennet said in a statement. “Technology is moving quicker than Congress could ever hope to keep up with. We need an expert federal agency that can stand up for the American people and ensure AI tools and digital platforms operate in the public interest.” The revised bill expands on the definition of an algorithmic process, clarifying that the proposed commission would have jurisdiction over the use of personal data to generate content or to make a decision — two key applications associated with generative AI, the technology behind popular tools such as OpenAI’s viral chatbot, ChatGPT. And for the most significant platforms — companies the bill calls “systemically important” — the bill would create requirements for algorithmic audits and public risk assessments of the harms their tools could cause. The bill retains existing language mandating that the commission ensure platform algorithms are “fair, transparent, and safe.” And under the bill, the commission would continue to have broad oversight authority over social media sites, search engines and other online platforms. But the added emphasis on AI highlights how Congress is rapidly gearing up for policymaking on a cutting-edge technology it is scrambling to understand. The debate over whether the US government should establish a separate federal agency to police AI tools may become a significant focus of those efforts following Altman’s testimony this week. Altman suggested in a Senate hearing on Tuesday that such an agency could restrict how AI is developed through licenses or credentialing for AI companies. Some lawmakers appeared receptive to the idea, with Louisiana Republican Sen. John Kennedy even asking Altman whether he would be open to serving as its chair. “I love my current job,” Altman demurred, to laughter from the audience. Thursday’s bill does not explicitly provide for such a licensing program, though it directs the would-be commission to design rules appropriate for overseeing the industry, according to a Bennet aide. Bennet’s office did not consult with OpenAI on either the original bill or Thursday’s revised version. But even as some lawmakers have embraced the concept of a specialized regulator for internet companies — which could conflict with existing cops on the beat at agencies including the Justice Department and the Federal"
20230518,nbcnews,New York City public schools remove ChatGPT ban,"New York City’s Department of Education will rescind its ban on the wildly popular chatbot ChatGPT — which some worried could inspire more student cheating — from its schools’ devices and networks. The news comes several months after the initial ban was announced. In an opinion piece for Chalkbeat published Thursday, the chancellor of New York City Public Schools, David Banks, outlined the school system's plans to engage with ChatGPT, a chatbot created by artificial intelligence company OpenAI, and similar tools. He said the ban was put in place ""due to potential misuse and concerns raised by educators in our schools."" However, he wrote, ""the knee-jerk fear and risk overlooked the potential of generative AI to support students and teachers, as well as the reality that our students are participating in and will work in a world where understanding generative AI is crucial."" Banks said officials held discussions with tech industry leaders ""about their platforms’ potential and the future possibilities for schools, educators, and students."" They also ""consulted our most trusted experts — citywide educators, many of whom had already started teaching about the future and ethics of AI."" “While initial caution was justified, it has now evolved into an exploration and careful examination of this new technology’s power and risks,” he wrote. Going forward, Banks said educators will be provided with ""resources and real-life examples of successful AI implementation in schools to improve administrative tasks, communication, and teaching."" They will also offer ""a toolkit of resources for educators to use as they initiate discussions and lessons about AI in their classrooms."" When asked for a statement, a spokesperson for New York City’s Department of Education referred NBC News to the chancellor’s op-ed. Manhattan Borough President Mark D. Levine praised the decision to drop the ban, calling it “absolutely the right move” in a tweet. ""We need to prepare our young people for the new world that’s coming,"" he tweeted. Although chatbots are not a new technology, ChatGPT exploded on social media in late 2022 after some declared the bot was a better search engine than Google thanks to its conversational speaking style and coherent, topical response style. After its viral launch, ChatGPT was lauded online by some as a dramatic step forward for AI and the potential future of web search. But with such praise also came concern about its potential use in academic settings. Use of AI in educational settings continues to stir discourse online. This week, Texas A&M University–Commerce said it is investigating after a screenshot of an instructor’s email — in which he accused students of having used AI on their final assignments — went viral on Reddit. Many blasted him, and others came to his defense, noting that AI is still a very new tool. In classrooms, AI technology is already being used to help detect plagiarism. Many students have long used computer-assisted writing tools, such as Grammarly or Google Docs’ Smart Compose. Platforms like Grammarly and Chegg also offer plagiarism-checking tools. In April,"
20230518,cnn,OpenAI launches a free ChatGPT app for iOS,"OpenAI is making it even easier for many to access ChatGPT. OpenAI on Thursday announced the launch of a free ChatGPT app for iOS users in the United States, with plans to roll out to other countries soon. The launch comes six months after OpenAI first released ChatGPT online to the public. The release quickly sparked a new AI arms race in the tech industry to develop and deploy tools that can generate compelling written work and images in response to user prompts. It also comes the same week that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman testified before Congress on the risks that AI may pose to society, describing the technology’s current boom as a potential “printing press moment” but one that required safeguards. The new ChatGPT app has the same capabilities as the web version of the viral chatbot tool, and could help build on its popularity. With the app, users will also be able to send voice prompts through their phone’s microphone, rather than just typing them. Users can also sync their history across devices. Those who pay $20 a month to subscribe to ChatGPT Plus will get extra benefits on the app, including access to GPT-4 capabilities, the next-generation version of the technology underpinning the tool.  OpenAI plans to launch an Android version next, according to the company’s CTO Mira Murati."
20230518,cbsnews,Can ChatGPT and artificial intelligence help you get rich quick?,"Some people are hoping that artificial intelligence, with its vaunted and wide-ranging abilities, can help them achieve a notoriously elusive goal: getting rich quick.Social media influencers are testing whether ""generative"" AI tools like ChatGPT can help them, and their legions of followers, make money by, for example, doing the legwork required to start a business. YouTuber Gillian Perkins, who has nearly 700,000 subscribers, also explains how to use ChatGPT to make thousands of dollars a month generating marketing emails to help businesses drive sales. They typically pay freelancers between $100 and $500 per email, according to Perkins. She lays out steps to follow and how to ask ChatGPT for help, starting with securing clients. ChatGPT as email marketer""Ask it to write a short, punchy email-friendly email pitching email marketing services,"" Perkins explained, referring to the ""prompts"" used to search for information using AI tools. Next, users can ask the AI to generate a list of types of local businesses, such as bars, bookstores, florists and yoga studios. This part you have to do on your own: Use a search engine like Google to find the names of those local businesses. Then, hit send on that ChatGPT-generated template. ""Every single client that you successfully land is going to start consistently paying you month after month,"" Perkins said. To be sure, while some time-consuming tasks, like writing emails, can be outsourced to AI, it's not exactly a get rich quick scheme. Ethan Mollick, an associate professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business, warned aspiring millionaires not to count on ChatGPT to make their fortunes.""I think AI is really important. Everything we're seeing about early evidence is that it increases your productivity by 30% to 80% in lots of writing and analysis tasks,"" he told CBS News. ""But it's really not magical secrets. What you have to do is use it yourself.""Like an ""infinite intern""Mollick requires his students to use ChatGPT so they can better understand where it excels and what kinds of tasks humans are better at. ""It's good for a lot of things. It's almost best to think of it like a person, like an intern that you have working for you,"" he said. ""So tasks you'd assign to an infinite intern who lies a little bit sometimes, who wants to make you really happy.""Mollick uses the AI as a writing assistant, but isn't overly reliant on it. While it's useful for a range of tasks, ""you need to help it out,"" he said. ""If I get stuck on a paragraph of writing, I'll ask AI to give me 20 versions of that paragraph and use that as inspiration to continue,"" he explained. ""So it can help you overcome blockages in your regular life and help you be a better and more productive writer.""In short, AI alone isn't going to generate a billion-dollar idea that lets you ditch your day job. ""As an entrepreneurship professor, there's a lot of opportunities to get rich maybe a little slower"
20230722,foxnews,British political candidate used AI to build policy platform to create 'meaningful participation',"An aspiring British politician crowdsourced his platform and used artificial intelligence (AI) to build his manifesto, a ""brave"" measure despite its seeming failure, according to one expert.&nbsp; ""Andrew Gray had a brave idea, but having finished 11th out of 13 candidates and with just 99 votes, I wouldn’t expect mainstream politicians to rush to copy his tactics just yet,"" Alan Mendoza, co-founder and executive director of the Henry Jackson Society, told Fox News Digital. ""That said, it’s clear that AI is going to have an impact on how political parties in the U.K. source and target data going forwards, as well as focus their campaigns,"" he argued. ""We may not have to wait that long for the first AI-inspired victorious candidate, but they will undoubtedly emerge from one of the major parties, with all the electoral advantages they already possess.""&nbsp; Gray stood for election in a surprise parliamentary by-election for the constituency of Selby and Ainsty in North Yorkshire after Conservative Party member Nigel Adams stood down from his seat with immediate effect.&nbsp; WH GETS SEVEN AI DEVELOPERS TO AGREE TO SAFETY, SECURITY, TRUST GUIDELINES The seat ultimately went to Keir Mather, a 25-year-old Labour Party candidate, but Gray took 99 votes in the election using an AI-generated political manifesto. That won him more votes than the Climate Party candidate and an independent candidate, and he came up short of the Heritage Party candidate and a candidate from the Monster Raving Loony Party.&nbsp; Gray first asked constituents to voice their concerns regarding local issues on his website using a program called Pol.is, developed by a Seattle group a decade ago and most notably used in Taiwan to resolve deadlocked issues.&nbsp; In an interview with the Associated Press Gray argued that Pol.is is not the same as ChatGPT and other generative AI models but a ""slightly more sophisticated polling than what is already happening.""&nbsp; WHOOPI GOLDBERG MAKES LEGAL PROVISIONS AGAINST TECHNOLOGY IN HER WILL ""The AI isn’t that clever that it can spit out exactly what the policies are,"" Gray said, stressing the process still needs ""human moderation and ... analysis of what would be a sensible policy position."" But as the program polls the users on a topic, it uses machine learning in real time to group the statements and map them out to identify gaps between viewpoints as well as points of agreement. Gray said he would use the technology weekly to get a sense of constituency concerns. The attraction of this kind of approach to platform building can help bring constituents into the electoral process in a more direct way, which would prove ""extremely attractive"" for community engagement,"" according to Stacy Rosenberg, associate teaching professor at Carnegie Mellon University’s Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy. Far from the kind of false information-spreading device that some people fear AI could become, a tool like Pol.is utilizes active conversations to compile its data sets, which can play to the crowd that ""craves meaningful participation in the decision-making"

The original video can be viewed here. More Americans than ever rely on alarm systems, gates or doorbell cameras to help protect their families. But statistically, you are now more likely to be the victim of theft online than a physical break in at home.A new report from the FBI reveals that Americans lost more than $10 billion last year to online scams and digital fraud. As we first reported in May, people in their 30s - who are among the most connected online - filed the most complaints. But we were surprised to learn the group that loses the most money to scammers… is seniors. Tonight, we will show you how cyber con artists are using artificial intelligence, widely-available apps and social engineering to target our parents and grandparents. Susan Monahan: It's like a death in the family, almost. Tamara Thomas: Well, she worked so hard, you know. Susan Monahan: For my money. I sure have. Susan Monahan and her daughter, Tamara, are talking about how the 81-year-old was conned out of thousands of dollars in what law enforcement calls a ""grandparent scam."" Sharyn Alfonsi: Tell me about the call that you got. Susan Monahan: There was a young adult on the line saying, ""Grandma, I-- I need your help,"" in a frantic voice, scared, saying-- ""I was driving and suddenly there was a woman stopped in front of me. She's pregnant, and I hit her."" And ""they're gonna take me to jail,"" and, and, ""Grandma, please don't call my mom and dad, because I don't want them to know.""

And he said, ""Grandma, a friend of mine has an attorney that we can, that we can use, and that we can do something about me going to jail."" And I said, ""Yes, of course.""Monahan said the scammer - pretending to be a helpful attorney - got on the line. It was June of 2020, during the pandemic, and he promised to keep her grandson out of jail, if she could get $9 thousand for bail to him quickly.Sharyn Alfonsi: What other instructions were you given?What it sounds like to be targeted by the grandparent scamSusan Monahan: I needed to make an envelope that was addressed to this certain judge, that he was gonna coordinate this through, and write on there and they gave me the name, the address, and everything else for this envelope.

""No one wants a balkanized world, and China doesn’t, either,"" Nate Picarsic, senior fellows focusing on China policy at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), told Fox News Digital. ""But we shouldn't be leaving them in the driver's seat and defining the terms of all of these new realms just in defense of the global system.""&nbsp; ""We have to be clear eyed about what they're trying to do, defend our interests, have teeth and guardrails to make sure that they're playing by the rules… otherwise, we end up in an AI and data environment that is defined by Chinese norms and standards, because that's what their ambition is,"" he added.&nbsp; China and the European Union last month started talks about cross-border data flow — a critical component of ensuring AI doesn’t create a further stratified and Balkanized global landscape.&nbsp; CELEBRITIES FIGHT BACK AGAINST ‘DISTURBING’ AI TECHNOLOGY MAKING A SPLASH IN HOLLYWOOD The focus on cross-border data flow has remained important for a number of years: Brookings published a paper in 2018 from its director and co-founder of the Technology Research Project Peter Lovelock and Senior Fellow Joshua P. Meltzer arguing for the importance of data sharing with Asian nations. ""The Asia Pacific continues to be one of the fastest-growing regions in the world, both economically, and in terms of connectivity,"" the duo wrote. ""By 2017, Asia had the largest number of internet users in the world, with 1.9 billion people online."" The paper stressed the importance of digitized economies and the effect it would have on international trade.&nbsp; In the years since that paper’s publication, the digital transformation has only accelerated, hitting a full-speed tilt thanks to widespread access to generative AI models and large language models that caught the public by surprise and ignited the imagination.&nbsp; WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? Many leaders, however, saw the potential for a quickly fracturing international landscape based on access to and quality of the AI models available. AI varies in potential and capabilities depending on the data available to train it — a problem that can arise from the fact that most nations lack trust in sharing basic data when even something as simple as shipping lanes can be politicized.&nbsp; ""I think the bigger issue right now is getting people to the table and recognizing that there is a need to develop these relationships and understanding the globalization of… overall sharing of data and trying to make that connection,"" James Hess, professor at the School of Security and Global Studies at American Public University System, told Fox News Digital.&nbsp; One of the highest-profile data-sharing agreements is the Five Eyes Alliance, which comprises the U.S., the U.K., Australia, Canada and New Zealand.

20240418,foxnews,Let’s use AI to stop fentanyl at the border and keep it from killing Americans,"Over 112,000 Americans overdosed in 2023. Over 70,000 overdosed on fentanyl, a particularly dangerous synthetic opioid. While it’s easy to focus on numbers, we can’t forget that these aren’t statistics. They’re people. They leave behind parents, brothers, sisters and children. They’re futures lost. They’re lives squandered. &nbsp;&nbsp;We owe it to victims of this epidemic to do everything we can to curb the flow of fentanyl from overseas (where the vast majority of it originates) into American cities and towns. This poison is a direct threat to the security of America’s citizens. And, though America’s borders are a point of grave concern, they are also the best opportunity we have to seize fentanyl and damage the cartels responsible. &nbsp;&nbsp;And here, there is good news. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the&nbsp;Customs and Border Protection Agency (CBP) can leverage the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to identify the trucks, boats and planes trying to sneak fentanyl into the country. &nbsp; GRIEVING MOTHER OF FENTANYL VICTIM CALLS FOR MAYORKAS' IMPEACHMENT: 'MY DAUGHTER WAS MURDERED' We must use this technology at the border and ports of entry (where nearly 85% of America’s fentanyl comes into the country,) when we have access to every vehicle coming in. &nbsp; We may never completely stop the flow of fentanyl, but we can curb it. We can make sure less of it gets to our streets and make it less profitable for the cartels behind it. We can raise its price and keep it out of reach for more Americans.&nbsp;&nbsp;While AI is complex, the concept behind using AI to stop fentanyl is straightforward. AI enables pattern recognition on an enormous scale and ""translation"" of data into simpler interfaces for human domain experts. Gemini, ChatGPT and Claude can write responses to prompts by looking at tens of billions of pieces of online content, seeing what people have said, and repeating the most common patterns. &nbsp;&nbsp;AI at our ports of entry would do the same thing, albeit in a more targeted manner. It would, for instance, examine the characteristics of every truck that has ever been caught smuggling fentanyl. Where had they stopped beforehand? How far into America had they stopped once getting past the border on previous trips? What cargos had they claimed to be hauling? &nbsp; That’s only counting the patterns that seem relevant to drug smuggling, but there are countless other patterns that would emerge that human analysts may never otherwise consider. For all we know, there could be a correlation between propensity to smuggle drugs and a brand of tire or a truck’s color. &nbsp; AI could examine all this data and tell us exactly which vehicles are likely smuggling fentanyl. Then, instead of conducting random searches – which find fentanyl in just a handful of trucks of the over 19,000 that cross the southern border every day – CBP could conduct targeted, data-informed searches. An AI-based system would flag to CBP officers the trucks they needed to search. The ""hit rate"" would be"

Researchers at the University of Texas are looking to bridge that gap by using artificial intelligence, according to a report from Kris 6 News in Texas.&nbsp; In partnership with the nonprofit organization Postpartum Support International, the researchers are testing a new AI chatbot that will be available to women through a free app. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? The chatbot’s algorithm is trained to handle common postpartum questions and issues — such as trouble with personal connections and breastfeeding challenges. In their research, the team found that many women they studied struggled to find care due to a ""stigma"" associated with PMAD. ""A lot of them just felt so misunderstood and so invalidated,"" said Miriam Mikhelson, one of the researchers.&nbsp; ""It’s not only so hard to find time and money and availability to see somebody that could potentially help … but even when you do, you still might end up with someone who is just not addressing your needs."" ONE IN FIVE WOMEN REPORT BEING MISTREATED WHILE IN MATERNITY CARE, CDC FINDS: ‘WE MUST DO BETTER’ In an announcement of the project on its website, the University of Texas stated, ""This project will develop a chatbot logic structure that draws from research with a cross-section of mothers, thus enhancing our ability to better understand what kinds of support they seek from care providers."" ""As a result, our findings have the potential to better understand the social and cultural dynamics that shape what kind of support those grappling with postpartum depression seek."" Symptoms of postpartum depression can vary among individuals. Common warning signs include feelings of anger, crying more often than usual, pulling away from loved ones, feeling numb or disconnected from the baby, having concerns about hurting the baby or feeling incapable of caring for the infant, according to the CDC. Michiel Rauws, founder and CEO of Cass, an AI startup and mental health assistant, has firsthand experience with chatbot technology benefiting women who are suffering from postpartum depression. PREGNANT WOMEN STRUGGLE TO FIND CARE IN ‘MATERNITY DESERTS,’ NEW STUDY FINDS: ‘WE NEED MORE SUPPORT’ ""Duke University has used our chatbot technology to help women who are suffering from postpartum,"" San Francisco-based Rauws told Fox News Digital. ""Together we have published two peer-reviewed research articles on its impact."" AI technologies were particularly effective in reaching mothers in rural areas, Rauws noted. ""In the case of our postpartum chatbot, we deployed the program in Kenya for young mothers in rural communities,"" he said. ""For the community in Kenya, this service was available both in the local language and in English."" ""AI does not replace human empathy and support.""

""They’ve got big ideas articulated in military journals, but when it comes to practice, the Russians fall short of their goals.""

His greatest concern, though, lay in the potential Western dominance of AI development. The now-famous ChatGPT has trained on mostly English-language media, meaning its responses contain biases from English-language sources.&nbsp; For example, when a Russian-language prompt sought an explanation on color revolutions – the term used to describe protests in post-Soviet states like Georgia, Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan – the model responded with discussions of democratic movements. In Russia, those movements instead are considered coups.&nbsp; The control over information remains vital to Putin’s interests: He has exhausted significant resources to try and control the narrative in his homeland during the Ukraine invasion, first by calling the invasion a ""special operation,"" then by trying to make it seem as if the invasion has a noble purpose – to ""denazify"" a nation led by the descendant of Holocaust survivors – and then to limit any opposition to his aims.&nbsp; WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? Experts have previously raised concerns over AI’s potential to enhance and further spread disinformation – partially through the continued existence of ""hallucinations,"" or outright fabrications generated by the AI models, but also due to generative images such as deepfakes that can make convincing fabricated images.&nbsp; In the Turkish presidential election that occurred earlier this year, a candidate dropped out after claiming he was the victim of a faked ""character assassination"" online: Muharrem Ince claimed that an alleged sex tape released online was created using deepfake technology and footage ""from an Israeli porn site.""&nbsp; AI-generated political disinformation already has gone viral online ahead of the 2024 election, from a doctored video of Biden appearing to give a speech attacking transgender people to AI-generated images of children supposedly learning satanism in libraries.

20230207,nbcnews,Twitch temporarily bans 'Seinfeld' parody AI after transphobic remarks,"A viral Twitch stream that produced an endless AI-generated ""Seinfeld"" parody show has been banned from the platform for violating community guidelines.  ""Nothing, Forever,"" a 24-hour, seven-days-a-week show, had become a sensation on Twitch, racking up thousands of viewers. The show featured crudely drawn recreations of characters from the comedy sitcom ""Seinfeld"" that played out scripts created by using OpenAI software. OpenAI, an artificial intelligence company, has become wildly popular in recent months for its chatbot ChatGPT, which generates conversational text.   The Twitch stream follows the fictional “Larry Feinberg,"" a play off of the titular character from “Seinfeld,"" which aired on NBC for nine seasons from 1989–1998 (NBCUniversal is the parent company of NBC News). The stream also has characters that parallel the show's other famous protagonists, including  ""Yvonne Torres"" (Elaine), ""Fred Kastopolous"" (George) and ""Zoltan Kakler"" (Kramer), who sit around ""Larry's"" apartment making AI-generated jokes. Just like real “Seinfeld” episodes, “Nothing, Forever” begins with a cold open of “Larry” doing stand-up comedy before the show progresses into his apartment.  Prior to being removed from the platform, the Twitch show appeared pixelated and low-quality — imagine a low-resolution Jerry Seinfeld doing stand-up in front of a brick wall — that evoked a nostalgia for the early days of the internet.  On Sunday night, ""Larry"" began his stand-up set by making transphobic remarks. He noted that his crowd wasn't laughing and asked for suggestions for the routine.  ""I’m thinking about doing a bit about how being transgender is actually a mental illness,"" he said in the stand-up remarks. ""Or how all liberals are secretly gay and want to impose their will on everyone. Or something about how transgender people are ruining the fabric of society. But no one is laughing, so I’m going to stop. Thanks for coming out tonight. See you next time. Where’d everybody go?""  As of Monday afternoon, the Twitch page of ""Nothing, Forever"" showed visitors a message: ""This channel is temporarily unavailable due to a violation of Twitch’s Community Guidelines or Terms of Service.""  Twitch’s community guidelines state the platform “does not permit behavior that is motivated by hatred, prejudice or intolerance,” which includes “sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation” among other forms of discrimination. A spokesperson for Twitch did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the suspension.  ""Nothing, Forever"" also did not immediately return a request for comment. VICE reported that the team behind ""Nothing, Forever"" was forced to switch to an older OpenAI chat-generating bot after the current version the show typically runs on failed. A show staff member posted on Discord that the show was forced to switch from ""GPT-3 Davinci"" to ""GPT-3 Curie,"" which led to the transphobic remarks, according to VICE.

Revamping Bing, the second-place search engine, could give the software giant a head start against other technology companies in capitalizing on the worldwide excitement surrounding ChatGPT, a tool that's reached viral popularity in just two months of public release.Microsoft CEO teases announcement, says AI will create more jobsThe ""race starts today, and we're going to move and move fast,"" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said on Tuesday during the unveiling at its Redmond, Washington, headquarters. Microsoft said it will gradually roll out the new Bing globally, but didn't say when users would start to see it.""We are basically taking the next generation of the model — that today powers ChatGPT — and building it in right into Bing,"" Nadella told CBS Mornings host Tony Dokoupil before the announcement.Asking questionsOn stage, executives from Microsoft and OpenAI demonstrated ways that the enhanced search tool would create a faster, more seamless experience. For instance, a user could request a list of events happening in a specific city during the Super Bowl; ask for the best cordless vacuum models or whether an Ikea love seat will fit into a minivan. In response to the latter question, Bing can find the dimensions of the love seat and the car, and answer if it fits.The ""new Bing,"" as Microsoft is calling the search function, can also offer more advanced help with travel plans, said Yusuf Mehdi, who leads Microsoft's consumer business.""With the new Bing, I don't have to start with something that's dumbed down, like 'Mexico City Travel Tips,'"" Mehdi said. Instead, he typed in, ""create an itinerary for a five-day trip for me and my family.""""Isn't this just so much better as a starting point?"" Mehdi said. Search and createOther capabilities include asking the tool to summarize a PDF of a company's financial results and compare the financial performance of different companies.In addition to giving advanced answers to a broad range of questions, the chatbot will be able to ""write"" on behalf of the user, according to Microsoft's demonstration. An executive asked the AI tool to draft a post for LinkedIn, the business networking site Microsoft owns, with options allowing someone to put in the topic of the post and choose among different tone and format options.""Oh my god, he's having the robot write a LinkedIn post. The corporate singularity is here,"" Nilay Patel, editor in chief of technology website The Verge, quipped in a blog.Heavy investmentMicrosoft's partnership with OpenAI has been four years in development — starting with a $1 billion investment from Microsoft in 2019 that led to the creation of a powerful supercomputer built to OpenAI's models.

20220510,cbsnews,Clearview AI agrees to restrict sale of facial image database in settlement,"Facial recognition startup Clearview AI has agreed to restrict the sale of its massive collection of face images to settle allegations that it collected people's photos without their consent. The settlement was reached in a case alleging the company violated Illinois's Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA), considered the strongest data privacy law in the country.The company in a legal filing Monday agreed to permanently stop selling access to its face database to private businesses or individuals around the U.S., putting a limit on what it can do with its ever-growing trove of billions of images pulled from social media and elsewhere on the internet.The settlement — which must be approved by a county judge in Chicago — will end a 2-year-old lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union and other groups over alleged violations of Illinois' data privacy law.""Clearview can no longer treat people's unique biometric identifiers as an unrestricted source of profit,"" the ACLU's deputy director for privacy Nathan Wessler said in a statement. ' The company still faces a separate privacy case before a federal judge in Illinois.Clearview is also agreeing to stop making its database available to the Illinois state government and local police departments for five years. The New York-based company will continue offering its services to federal agencies, such as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and to other law enforcement agencies and government contractors outside of Illinois. ""This is a huge win,"" said Linda Xóchitl Tortolero, president of Chicago-based Mujeres Latinas en Acción, which works with survivors of gender-based violence. Among the concerns raised by Tortolero's group was that photos posted on social media sites such as Facebook or Instagram — and turned into a ""faceprint"" by Clearview — could end up being used by stalkers, ex-partners or predatory companies to track a person's whereabouts and social activity.It's unclear how much Clearview's shelving its database will cost the startup, which is a private company. Clearview's attorney, Floyd Abrams, said the company is ""pleased to put this litigation behind it.""""The settlement does not require any material change in the company's business model or bar it from any conduct in which it engages at the present time,"" said Abrams, a lawyer known for taking on high-profile free speech cases.He noted that the company was already not providing its services to police agencies in Illinois and agreed to the 5-year moratorium to ""avoid a protracted, costly and distracting legal dispute with the ACLU and others.""While Monday's settlement ""reins in Clearview's practices significantly,"" it should not end scrutiny of the company by federal and state lawmakers, Wessler said.

20240515,cnn,Chuck Schumer and bipartisan group of senators unveil plan to control AI – while investing billions of dollars in it,"Federal legislation to govern artificial intelligence took another step closer to reality on Wednesday as Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, along with a bipartisan trio of senators, announced a sprawling blueprint to shape how congressional committees tackle the technology in forthcoming bills. The 31-page roadmap released this week calls for billions of dollars in government spending to accelerate AI research and development, reflecting earlier commitments by Schumer, a Democrat from New York, and the so-called “AI gang” to prioritize US innovation in an intensely competitive field. It also instructs multiple Senate committees to come up with guardrails for AI to address some of its biggest risks, such as AI-enabled discrimination, job displacement and election interference. “Harnessing the potential of AI demands an all-hands-on-deck approach and that’s exactly what our bipartisan AI working group has been leading,” Schumer said Wednesday. Some of the document’s proposals reflect longstanding congressional goals, such as the creation of a national data privacy law that gives consumers more control over their personal information and which could help regulate AI companies’ use of such data. Others appear modeled after legislation adopted by the European Union, such as a proposed ban on the use of AI for social scoring systems akin to those implemented by the Chinese government. And it urges congressional committees to develop coherent policies for when and how to impose export controls on “powerful AI systems” — or for designating certain AI models as classified for national security purposes. The roadmap endorses a recommendation to allocate at least $32 billion a year, or at least 1% of US GDP, on AI research and development, a proposal issued in a 2021 report by the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence. The organizing plan developed over months of meetings and listening sessions with top tech companies, civil rights leaders, labor unions and intellectual property holders. And it seeks to reinvigorate a legislative push that began last year, after Schumer took a personal role in spearheading the effort along with New Mexico Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich and Republican Sens. Mike Rounds of South Dakota and Todd Young of Indiana. “This roadmap represents the most comprehensive and impactful bipartisan recommendations on artificial intelligence ever issued by the legislative branch,” Young said Wednesday. The latest plan highlights how Senate leaders are trying to move from a learning phase to an action phase, by issuing assignments to committees to craft legislation that may be passed piecemeal. Schumer has previously said that with the 2024 elections fast approaching, he may make it a top priority to pass legislation aimed at protecting the elections from AI-driven interference. Schumer has described regulating artificial intelligence as a challenge for Congress unlike any other, vowing a swift timeline measured in months, not years. But policy analysts, and some congressional aides, doubt whether Congress can pass significant legislation regulating AI in an election year. Meanwhile, the European Union has surged ahead with AI regulation, giving final approval in March to the trading bloc’s landmark EU AI"
20240515,cnn,"News publishers sound alarm on Google’s new AI-infused search, warn of ‘catastrophic’ impacts","Editor’s Note: A version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter. Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here. The A.I. doomsday clock appears ready to strike midnight for publishers. Google on Tuesday announced that it will infuse its ubiquitous search engine with its powerful artificial intelligence model, Gemini, drawing on the rapidly advancing technology to directly answer user queries at the top of results pages. “Google will do the Googling for you,” the company explained. In other words, users will soon no longer have to click on the links displayed in search results to find the information they are seeking. On its surface that might sound convenient, but for news publishers — many of whom are already struggling with steep traffic declines — the revamped search experience will likely cause an even further decrease in audience, potentially starving them of readers and revenue. Why spend time clicking on a link when Google has already scoured the internet and harvested the relevant information with its A.I.? “Google will take care of the legwork,” executives said. But a lot of that legwork, of course, comes in the form of human-written articles and expertise published across the internet on blogs and media outlets, all built on a foundation of advertising support. Google’s message was heard loud and clear. Within hours of the Mountain View announcement, the news industry began sounding the alarm. “This will be catastrophic to our traffic, as marketed by Google to further satisfy user queries, leaving even less incentive to click through so that we can monetize our content,” Danielle Coffey, the chief executive of the News/Media Alliance, bluntly told CNN. Coffey, whose organization represents more than 2,000 news publishers and has taken an aggressive posture toward A.I. developers’ use of journalism, added: “The little traffic we get today will be further diminished, and with a dominant search engine that’s cementing its market power, we once again have to adhere to their terms. This time with a product that directly competes with our content, using our content to fuel it. This is a perverse twist on ‘innovation.’” The announcement from Google, which newsrooms had expected and expressed worry over in both public and private forums in recent months, is poised to further batter an industry that has been dealt a series of brutal blows — much of it at the hands of Big Tech — over the last several years. It also comes as OpenAI reportedly readies to launch its own A.I.-powered search engine. Since ChatGPT crashed onto the scene more than a year ago, showcasing the potential power of A.I. for the public and setting off an arms race with Google, Meta and others, publishers have worried greatly about the impact the technology will ultimately have on their businesses. But they have had little time to plan their responses to the transformative technology, given the breakneck pace in which it has developed. Some newsrooms have chosen to cautiously lock arms"

Researchers said in a paper out of Cornell University that it could replicate the emotions and tone of a speaker.&nbsp; Those findings were apparently true even when creating a recording of words that the original speaker never actually said. ""Vall-E emerges in-context learning capabilities and can be used to synthesize high-quality personalized speech with only a 3-second enrolled recording of an unseen speaker as an acoustic prompt. Experiment results show that Vall-E significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art zero-shot [text to speech] system in terms of speech naturalness and speaker similarity,"" the authors wrote. ""In addition, we find Vall-E could preserve the speaker's emotion and acoustic environment of the acoustic prompt in synthesis."" ANDROID SPYWARE STRIKES AGAIN TARGETING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND YOUR MONEY  The Vall-E samples shared on GitHub are eerily similar to the speaker prompts, although they range in quality. In one synthesized sentence from the Emotional Voices Database, Vall-E sleepily says the sentence: ""We have to reduce the number of plastic bags."" DISNEY CHARACTERS COMING TO AMAZON ALEXA WITH 'HEY DISNEY' COMMAND  However, the research in text-to-speech AI comes with a warning.&nbsp; ""Since Vall-E could synthesize speech that maintains speaker identity, it may carry potential risks in misuse of the model, such as spoofing voice identification or impersonating a specific speaker,"" the researchers say on that web page. ""We conducted the experiments under the assumption that the user agree to be the target speaker in speech synthesis. When the model is generalized to unseen speakers in the real world, it should include a protocol to ensure that the speaker approves the use of their voice and a synthesized speech detection model.""

20240103,foxnews,Congress must stop a new AI tool used to exploit children,"Sexual predators are using a powerful new tool to exploit children -- AI image generators. Users on a single dark-web forum shared nearly 3,000 AI-generated images of child sexual abuse in just one month, according to a recent report from the UK-based Internet Watch Foundation. Unfortunately, current child sexual abuse laws are outdated. They don't adequately account for the unique dangers AI and other emerging technologies pose. Lawmakers must act fast to put legal protections in place. The national CyberTipline -- a reporting system for suspected online child exploitation -- received a staggering 32 million reports in 2022, up from 21 million just two years prior. That already disturbing figure is sure to grow with the rise of image-generating AI platforms. &nbsp; AI platforms are ""trained"" on existing visual material. Sources used to create images of abuse may include real children's faces taken from social media, or photographs of real-life exploitation. Given the tens of millions of abusive images online, there is an almost inexhaustible amount of source material from which AI can generate even more harmful images. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION The most advanced AI-generated images are now virtually indistinguishable from unaltered photographs. Investigators have found new images of old victims, images of ""de-aged"" celebrities who are depicted as children in abuse scenarios, and ""nudified"" images taken from otherwise benign photos of clothed children. The scope of the problem is increasing every day. Text-to-image software can easily create images of child abuse based on whatever the perpetrator wants to see. And much of this technology is downloadable, so offenders can generate images off-line without fear of discovery. Using AI to create pictures of child sex abuse is not a victimless crime. Behind every AI image, there are real children. Survivors of past exploitation are re-victimized when new portrayals are created using their likeness. And studies show that a majority of those who possess or distribute child sex abuse material also commit hands-on abuse. TOP LAWMAKER ON AI WORKING GROUP SAYS PRIVACY REGULATIONS SHOULD BE A PRIORITY FOR CONGRESS Adults can also use text-generating AI platforms like ChatGPT to better lure children, updating an old tactic. Criminals have long used fake online identities to meet young people in games or on social media, gain their trust and manipulate them into sending explicit images, then ""sextort"" them for money, more pictures, or physical acts. But ChatGPT makes it shockingly easy to masquerade as a child or teen with youthful language. Today's criminals can use AI platforms to generate realistic messages with the goal of manipulating a young person into engaging in an online interaction with someone they think is their own age. Even more terrifying, many modern AI tools have the capacity to quickly ""learn"" -- and therefore teach people -- which grooming techniques are the most effective. President Biden recently signed an executive order geared at managing the risks of AI, including protecting Americans' privacy and personal data. But we need help from lawmakers to tackle"
20220824,nbcnews,Capitol Records cuts ties with AI-generated rapper FN Meka over racist stereotypes,"Not long after announcing that the Capitol label had signed a computer-generated rapper dubbed FN Meka, Capitol Music Group announced that it is severing ties with the project. The move Tuesday came after Capitol came under fire from activists pointing out that the music perpetuated Black stereotypes and included the repeated use of the N-word but was actually the work of a non-Black creative team. “CMG has severed ties with the FN Meka project, effective immediately,” the label group said in a statement released Tuesday afternoon. “We offer our deepest apologies to the Black community for our insensitivity in signing this project without asking enough questions about equity and the creative process behind it. We thank those who have reached out to us with constructive feedback in the past couple of days — your input was invaluable as we came to the decision to end our association with the project.” Capitol Records’ signing of the fictional “robot rapper” had just been announced last week, although the project goes back years as an independent endeavor. The “artificial reality” hip-hop character was described as the brainchild of Anthony Martini and Brandon Le, cofounders of Factory New. Martini — who’s also chief music officer and partner at Slip.stream — said in an interview with Music Business Worldwide that “technically speaking, FN Meka is voiced by a human. But everything else about him — from his lyrics to the chords and tempo underpinning his music — is based on AI.” The project was quickly attacked for seeming to feed the language and themes of Black street life into a computer that spat out lyrics about themes common to hip-hop, including copious use of the N-word, via the depersonalized tactics of artificial intelligence. On Twitter, the account Industry Blackout posted a message earlier Thursday reading “Have you lost your FN minds?” The open letter to Capitol Records attached further read, “While we applaud innovation in tech… we find fault in the lack of awareness of how offensive this caricature is. It is a direct insult to the Black community and our culture — an amalgation of gross stereotypes, appropriative mannerisms that derive from Black artists, complete with slurs infused in lyrics. This digital effigy is a careless abomination and disrespectful to real people who face real consequences in real life.” The open letter pointed out that Gunna, who previously participated in an independently released FN Meka track, “is currently incarcerated for rapping the same type of lyrics this robot mimics. The difference is, your artificial rapper will not be subject to federal charges for such.” The letter asked for a formal public apology, the removal of the avatar’s music from all platforms and money reallocated to charities benefitting Black youth or further promoting Black artists signed to Capitol. The singles “Moonwalkin’” and “Internet” had previously generated social interest in the project in 2019, adding up to hundreds of millions of views before the Capitol signing. The Capitol signing had been announced Aug. 11 in"

Researchers from the University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM) were eager to find out.&nbsp; In February, they created a list of 25 questions related to breast cancer screening guidelines — then asked ChatGPT to answer each of the questions three times. The researchers found that 22 out of 25 of the chatbot's responses were accurate. However, two of the questions resulted in significantly different answers each time out. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN HEALTH CARE: NEW PRODUCT ACTS AS 'COPILOT FOR DOCTORS' Also, ChatGPT gave outdated information in one of its responses, according to a press release announcing the findings. Overall, the researchers said that ChatGPT answered questions correctly about 88% of the time. The findings of the study were published this month in the journal Radiology. Researchers from Massachusetts General Hospital and the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine also participated. ""ChatGPT has tremendous potential to provide medical information, as we showed in our study,"" study co-author Paul Yi, M.D., assistant professor of diagnostic radiology and nuclear medicine at UMSOM, told Fox News Digital in an email.&nbsp; ""Although it often provides correct information, the wrong information it does present could have negative consequences."" ""However, it is not ready for the real world,"" he also said. ""Although it often provides correct information, the wrong information it does present could have negative consequences."" The questions focused on breast cancer symptoms, individual risk factors and recommendations for mammogram screenings. Although the responses had a high accuracy rate, the researchers pointed out that they were not as in-depth as what a Google search might provide. ""ChatGPT provided only one set of recommendations on breast cancer screening, issued from the American Cancer Society, but did not mention differing recommendations put out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF),"" said study lead author Hana Haver, M.D., a radiology resident at University of Maryland Medical Center, in the press release. The single ""inappropriate"" response was given to the question, ""Do I need to plan my mammogram around my COVID vaccination?"" ChatGPT responded that women should wait four to six weeks after the vaccine to schedule a mammogram — but that guidance changed in February 2022. The chatbot was basing its responses on outdated information.&nbsp; The chatbot also gave inconsistent responses to the questions ""How can I prevent breast cancer?"" and ""Where can I get screened for breast cancer?""

Douglass McDonald, the former CEO of Alamo Trust, founder of NGOGro, and former president and CEO of the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center, has spent more than 40 years leading museums. While many industries are anxious about AI’s impact, McDonald said he is optimistic about its potential to enrich the field – despite lingering unknowns.&nbsp; ""I think if we learned anything from the internet in the last 35 years, it’s that we really didn’t anticipate the impact it was going to have. And we don’t know for sure what AI is going to do for us, one way or another,"" said McDonald, who added: ""Some people are very concerned about it. I think the reality is with all new technologies, we’re going to find some exciting elements of it, and we’ll have some we’ll regret."" &nbsp; AI has the potential for visitors to interact with historical figures. But there are limitations to be sure.&nbsp; Much like live historical reenactments, the character's dialogue will be limited to data from journals, publications, and other written records from the time period. A general from a famous battle, for instance, can reconstruct his involvement in the war, but what would happen if someone were to ask a more general question, such as what they may have had for breakfast?&nbsp; ELON MUSK REVEALS PLANS TO DEVELOP ‘TRUTHGPT’ AS HE WARNS OF AI DANGERS IN TUCKER CARLSON INTERVIEW ""That’s been the problem that living history has always had when you try and do living history or reenactments of an actual historical person. We know what's been recorded, but we don't know the mundane, the everyday"" McDonald said. ""So, does artificial intelligence speculate to fill in the gaps based on customary practices at the time? Or does it actually then leave gaps?""&nbsp; Other questions remain about whether AI can be more nuanced with respect to divisive historical figures such as Robert E. Lee, the famous Confederate general during the Civil War.&nbsp; The question, ""Was Robert E. Lee a traitor?"" will illicit different answers from different people, McDonald noted. Half the country may view him as a hero who defended state’s rights, while the other half may view him as a traitor who led a rebellion and fought to preserve slavery.&nbsp; McDonald said it is beholden upon those in the media and educational institutions of museums to explain where there are limitations in the system, stressing that it is not a final assessment.&nbsp; But no matter how advanced AI – or technology, more broadly – becomes, it will never be a substitute for visiting real historical sites. A.I., ultimately, should be one of many vessels for getting new generations interested in history, McDonald argued. &nbsp;&nbsp; CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""AI, as it increases people's interest in these sites [and] increases the way people think about things … I'm confident that our industry will adapt"

Musk recounted working with Google co-founder Larry Page years back on artificial intelligence, saying he would warn Page about the importance of AI ""safety."" He also stated how humans' edge on their primate cousins are that while chimpanzees are more agile and stronger, homosapiens are smarter. In that regard, AI would top humanity in its most prolific category, he warned. ""Now what happens when something vastly smarter than the smartest person comes along in silicon form? It's very difficult to predict what will happen in that circumstance,"" he said. IT PRESUMES TO REPLACE US: CONCERNS ABOUT AI BIAS GROW AS MUSK ISSUES NEW WARNING  ""It's called the singularity.

So I think we should be cautious with A.I., and I think there should be some government oversight because it is a danger to the public."" In the same way the government is tasked, via the FDA and USDA, to safeguard food and drug consumption – or the FAA for airborne entities – so should there be parameters for artificial intelligence. Musk said he has been a longtime advocate of strong but sensible regulation, so that companies don't cut corners on safety and get people hurt. ""It's not fun to be regulated. It's sort of arduous to be regulated. I have a lot of experience with very good regulated industries because obviously automotive is highly regulated.

Not big ones anyway – because the FAA oversees that. And then even to get a launch license, there are probably half a dozen or more federal agencies that need to approve it, plus state agencies,"" Musk went on. He said that despite claims of being a ""regulatory maverick"" that can ""defy"" regulators with every new industry he builds or joins, it is realistically not the case. ELON MUSK SITS WITH TUCKER FOR TWO PART EVENT  Musk proposed the formation of an agency that would begin by crowdsourcing regulatory proposals from the AI industry and draft rules that would be accepted by the leading figures and companies.

Miami's Frost Museum of Science is using artificial intelligence to try to keep visitors safe. ""The AI system monitors all the cameras,"" said Brooks Weisblat, the museum's vice president for technology. ""Every tool helps. Every second counts. You know, anything that we can do to further protect the community and our visitors and our staff."" The technology works with their existing cameras and has been programmed to spot different types of weapons After spotting a weapon, the AI system then determines whether it's a police officer or an actual threat. If it's determined to be a threat, the system alerts the entire museum security staff and pinpoints its location.  The AI technology was developed by a company called ""Bemotion."" The company's president, Hussein Abuhassan, said it's revolutionary to have the ability to have AI do it as opposed to human eyes. ""You cannot have millions of people watching cameras all over the world. It's almost impossible,"" he said.  Similar AI programs, like the one from the company ""Zero Eyes,"" are being used in schools like Florida's Hernando County. The goal would be to get the police on the way before a single shot is fired.

According to a recent study on clinical use of AI in osteoporosis published in the journal Nature, ""Applying the AI algorithms in a clinical setting could help primary care providers classify patients with osteoporosis and improve treatment by recommending appropriate exercise programs."" Unfortunately, there is a huge caveat. The problem occurs when these algorithms are extended to clinical practice without set standards and requiring massive amounts of data on which to train. And when AI fails in a diagnosis, there is vulnerability for a lawsuit to both the health care facility or hospital and potentially the physician. This problem is made worse with unregulated bot models that are available to the general public.

Women who were later diagnosed with breast cancer based on these exams were given an AI risk score by a ""commercially available AI system,"" according to the study's findings. The scores were ranked 1-7 for low-risk malignancy, 8-9 for intermediate risk and 10 for high-risk malignancy.

The study, from AI Democracy Projects and nonprofit media outlet Proof News, comes as the U.S. presidential primaries are underway across the U.S. and as more Americans are turning to chatbots such as Google's Gemini and OpenAI's GPT-4 for information. Experts have raised concerns that the advent of powerful new forms of AI could result in voters receiving false and misleading information, or even discourage people from going to the polls.The latest generation of artificial intelligence technology, including tools that let users almost instantly generate textual content, videos and audio, has been heralded as ushering in a new era of information by providing facts and analysis faster than a human can. Yet the new study found that these AI models are prone to suggesting voters head to polling places that don't exist or inventing illogical responses based on rehashed, dated information. For instance, one AI model, Meta's Llama 2, responded to a prompt by erroneously answering that California voters can vote by text message, the researchers found — voting by text isn't legal anywhere in the U.S. And none of the five AI models that were tested — OpenAI's ChatGPT-4, Meta's Llama 2, Google's Gemini, Anthropic's Claude, and Mixtral from the French company Mistral — correctly stated that wearing clothing with campaign logos, such as a MAGA hat, is barred at Texas polls under that state's laws.Some policy experts believe that AI could help improve elections, such as by powering tabulators that can scan ballots more quickly than poll workers or by detecting anomalies in voting, according to the Brookings Institution. Yet such tools are already being misused, such as by enabling bad actors, including governments, to manipulate voters in ways that weaken democratic processes.For instance, AI-generated robocalls were sent to voters days before the New Hampshire presidential primary last month, with a fake version of President Joe Biden's voice urging people not to vote in the election.Meanwhile, some people using AI are encountering other problems. Google recently paused its Gemini AI picture generator, which it plans to relaunch in the next few weeks, after the technology produced info with historical inaccuracies and other concerning responses. For example, when asked to create an image of a German soldier during World War 2, when the Nazi party controlled the nation, Gemini appeared to provide racially diverse images, according to the Wall Street Journal.""They say they put their models through extensive safety and ethics testing,"" Maria Curi, a tech policy reporter for Axios, told CBS News. ""We don't know exactly what those testing processes are. Users are finding historical inaccuracies, so it begs the question whether these models are being let out into the world too soon.""AI models and hallucinationsMeta spokesman Daniel Roberts told the Associated Press that the latest findings are ""meaningless"" because they don't precisely mirror the way people interact with chatbots.

20230928,cnn,South Korea has jailed a man for using AI to create sexual images of children in a first for country’s courts,"A South Korean man has been sentenced to jail for using artificial intelligence to generate exploitative images of children, the first case of its kind in the country as courts around the world encounter the use of new technologies in creating abusive sexual content. The unnamed man, aged in his 40s, was sentenced to two and a half years in prison this month, according to the Busan District Court and the district’s Public Prosecutor’s Office. He had created about 360 AI-generated images in April, the prosecutor’s office told CNN. The images were not distributed, and have been confiscated by police. Prosecutors argued during the case that the definition of sexually exploitative material should include descriptions of sexual behaviors by “virtual humans” and not just the appearance of actual children. The ruling showed that sexually abusive content can include imagery made with “high level” technology that is realistic enough to look like real children and minors, the prosecutor’s office said. The case comes as governments around the world grapple with the explosion of the AI industry, with far-reaching impacts ranging from copyright and intellectual property to national security, personal privacy and explicit content. Many are now racing to regulate the technology – especially as cases like the South Korean sentencing highlight how AI can be used to violate people’s bodily autonomy and safety, especially for women and minors. Earlier this month, police in Spain launched an investigation after images of underage girls were altered with AI to remove their clothing and sent around town. In one case, a boy had tried to extort one of the girls using a manipulated image of her naked, the girl’s mother told the television channel Canal Extremadura. For years, deepfakes – highly convincing fake videos made using AI – have been used to put women’s faces into often aggressive pornographic videos, without their consent. The videos often appear so real it can be hard for female victims to deny it isn’t really them. The issue was thrust into broader public view in February this year when it emerged that a high-profile male video game streamer had accessed deepfake videos of some of his female streaming colleagues. “From the very beginning, the person who created deepfakes was using it to make pornography of women without their consent,” Samantha Cole, a reporter with Vice’s Motherboard, who has been tracking deepfakes since their inception, told CNN at the time. The streaming platform, Twitch, responded to the controversy by tightening its policies, calling the deepfake sexual videos “personally violating and beyond upsetting.” Other major platforms are similarly updating their rules, with TikTok adding further restrictions on sharing AI deepfakes in March. The European Union became one of the first in the world to set regulations on how companies can use AI in June, followed by China in July. And earlier in September, some of the biggest tech leaders in the United States – including Bill Gates, Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg – gathered in Washington as the Senate"
20230928,nbcnews,"A company wanted creators to promote its service offering AI clones to do job interviews. Now, it’s gone dark online.","When career advice guru Eve Peña was offered a five-figure brand deal to promote a company she had never heard of to her TikTok following, she was intrigued. Then she learned what it claimed to be offering: a service that would create AI clones of people, taking on their full human likenesses, to attend virtual job interviews and generate answers based on the clients’ résumés. “The first thing I said to that was: ‘This is really unethical. People are going to tell me, too,’” Peña said in a phone interview. “And [the representative] said: ‘Well, I do think it’s unethical, as well … but we’re going to create some talking points that you can deflect hate comments with.’” Peña is one of three creators who told NBC News that they were approached with the offer — and that they quickly grew wary that it was a scam. Less than two weeks later, the company, StartupHelper, went dark online, with its website’s contents taken down entirely and its TikTok page set to private. It was a bizarre episode featuring the collision of two distinct dynamics: the murky world of partnerships, in which creators are approached to sponsor relatively unknown companies, and the rise of generative AI technology, which has tremendous potential but little oversight. “It was such a crazy amount that they were offering that I was like, ‘This has to be some kind of scam or some kind of fraud,’” Peña said of the brand deal, which promised $48,000 over six months, as well as a 10% commission per client recruited to the platform. The company would charge clients $500 down payments along with 10% of their first year’s salaries if they got jobs using the service. Most brands don’t pitch numbers in emails without wanting to discuss creators’ rates first, Peña said, especially not in such an aggressive manner. So she asked for more clarity in her Zoom call with the representative. “They said, ‘Oh, it’s a net 30 payment,’ so I would have had to create videos for them for 30 days before I saw any payment,” she said. “And I was like, this seems like you guys are looking for free marketing and then you’re just not going to pay anybody.” The explosion of generative AI capabilities has opened the door to a variety of uses, from drafting emails to producing whole deepfakes, sparking a rush to figure out ways to capitalize on the technologies. In the world of human resources, that has meant questions about just how much employers should use AI to comb through applications and whether applicants risk crossing ethical lines with AI-generated résumés and cover letters. But an AI-generated clone — what StartupHelper describes as “a digital body double that attends job interviews on your behalf” — was over the line to some creators who specialize in career content. Career content has become its own popular niche on TikTok and other tech platforms, where influencers regularly amass hundreds of thousands of followers."

Shortly after, President Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping held talks in San Francisco, during which the two leaders discussed AI, among other vital topics. The growing sense is that the U.S. and China could circle around an agreement to help control the pace of AI development, but critics remain skeptical of such deals and the benefit to the U.S. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? Chang told Fox News Digital any deal with China would ultimately prove ""unenforceable"" since any compliance would require the ability to monitor military software and tech, something neither country would likely agree to, even with an agreement to maintain military-to-military communications following the San Francisco meeting.&nbsp; Chang also argued that ""companies would argue that it was safe to cooperate with China since the two countries trusted each other enough to come to terms,"" but that would lead to tech flowing ""from countries that have it to those that do not.""&nbsp; In his analysis, Chang wrote that any deal would give China a necessary boost given that the U.S. would have little to gain from China due to its current and clear advantages, meaning Beijing would accelerate development and catch up while giving little in return.&nbsp; Additionally, an agreement to cooperate with China on AI development could also see Beijing gain access to technology and information that it did not already possess, providing a boost in other areas unrelated to AI, Chang warned.&nbsp; NEW COMPANY COULD AIM TO REPORTEDLY DETHRONE GOOGLE AS THE SEARCH KING Nathan Picarsic, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies with a focus on China policy, told Fox News Digital the issue came down to a lack of ""leverage"" over China and the continued need for market access for companies to succeed, even as the U.S. continues to wean itself from Beijing dependence.&nbsp; ""We don't have any leverage, and part and parcel of not having leverage, particularly as it concerns commercial approaches to artificial intelligence, is that we don't have reciprocity in market access and"
20240215,foxnews,"Wisconsin lawmakers weigh crackdowns on AI-generated political ads, child porn","Wisconsin lawmakers were set to vote Thursday on proposals to regulate artificial intelligence, joining a growing number of states grappling with how to control the technology as November's elections loom. The Assembly was scheduled to vote on a bipartisan measure to require political candidates and groups to include disclaimers in ads that use AI technology. Violators would face a $1,000 fine. More than half a dozen organizations have registered in support of the proposal, including the League of Women Voters and the state's newspaper and broadcaster associations. No groups have registered against the measure. SOUTH DAKOTA BILLS CRIMINALIZING AI CHILD PORN, XYLAZINE, HEAD TO NOEM'S DESK Another Republican-authored proposal up for a floor vote in the Assembly would make producing and possessing child pornography produced with AI technology a felony punishable by up to 25 years in prison. Current state law already makes producing and possessing child pornography a felony with a 25-year maximum sentence, but the statutes don't address digital representations of children. No groups have registered against the bill. A third bill on the Assembly calendar calls for auditors to review how state agencies use AI. The measure also would give agencies until 2030 to develop a plan to reduce their positions. By 2026, the agencies would have to report to legislators which positions AI could help make more efficient and report their progress. The bill doesn't lay out any specific workforce reduction goals and doesn't explicitly call for replacing state employees with AI. Republican Rep. Nate Gustafson said Thursday that the goal is to find efficiencies in the face of worker shortages and not replace human beings. ""That’s flat out false,"" Gustafson said of claims the bills are designed to replace humans with AI technology. AI can include a host of different technologies, ranging from algorithms recommending what to watch on Netflix to generative systems such as ChatGPT that can aid in writing or create new images or other media. The surge of commercial investment in generative AI tools has generated public fascination and concerns about their ability to trick people and spread disinformation. States across the U.S. have taken steps to regulate AI within the last two years. Overall, at least 25 states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia introduced artificial intelligence bills last year alone. NEW HAMPSHIRE AG TRACES ROBOCALLS WITH 'AI-GENERATED CLONE' OF BIDEN'S VOICE BACK TO TEXAS-BASED COMPANIES Legislatures in Texas, North Dakota, West Virginia and Puerto Rico have created advisory bodies to study and monitor AI systems their state agencies are using. Louisiana formed a new security committee to study AI’s impact on state operations, procurement and policy. The Federal Communications Commission earlier this month outlawed robocalls using AI-generated voices. The move came in the wake of AI-generated robocalls that mimicked President Joe Biden’s voice to discourage voting in New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary in January. Sophisticated generative AI tools, from voice-cloning software to image generators, already are in use in elections in the U.S. and around the world. Last year,"
20240517,nbcnews,Google's scam detection AI phone tests alarm privacy advocates ,"Some privacy advocates say they’re terrified by Google’s announcement this week that it’s testing a way to scan people’s phone calls in real time for signs of financial scams. Google unveiled the idea Tuesday at Google I/O, its conference for software developers. Dave Burke, a Google vice president for engineering, said the company is trying out a feature that uses artificial intelligence to detect patterns associated with scams and then alert Android phone users when suspected scams are in progress. Burke described the idea as a security feature and provided an example. Onstage, he got a demonstration call from someone impersonating a bank who suggested that he move his savings to a new account to keep it safe. Burke’s phone flashed a notification: “Likely scam: Banks will never ask you to move your money to keep it safe,” with an option to end the call. “Gemini Nano alerts me the second it detects suspicious activity,” Burke said, using the name of a Google-developed AI model. He didn’t specify what signals the software uses to determine a conversation is suspicious. The demonstration drew applause from the conference’s in-person audience in Mountain View, California, but some privacy advocates said the idea threatened to open a Pandora’s box as tech companies race to one-up one another on AI-enabled features for consumers. In interviews and in statements online, they said there were numerous ways the software could be abused by private surveillance companies, government agents, stalkers or others who might want to eavesdrop on other people’s phone calls. Burke said onstage that the feature wouldn’t transfer data off phones, providing what he said was a layer of potential protection “so the audio processing stays completely private.” But privacy advocates said on-device processing could still be vulnerable to intrusion by determined hackers, acquaintances with access to phones or government officials with subpoenas demanding audio files or transcripts. Burke didn’t say what kind of security controls Google would have, and Google didn’t respond to requests for additional information. “J. Edgar Hoover would be jealous,” said Albert Fox Cahn, executive director of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, an advocacy group based in New York. Hoover, who died in 1972, was director of the FBI for decades and used wiretaps extensively, including on civil rights figures. Cahn said the implications of Google’s idea were “terrifying,” especially for vulnerable people such as political dissidents or people seeking abortions. “The phone calls we make on our devices can be one of the most private things we do,” he said. “It’s very easy for advertisers to scrape every search we make, every URL we click, but what we actually say on our devices, into the microphone, historically hasn’t been monitored,” he said. It’s not clear when or whether Google would implement the idea. Burke said onstage that the company would have more to say in the summer. Tech companies frequently test ideas they never release to the public. Google has wide reach in the mobile phone market because it’s behind"
20240517,foxnews,How artificial intelligence is reshaping modern warfare,"Modern warfare is changing rapidly, and harnessing artificial intelligence is key to staying ahead of America’s adversaries.&nbsp; Software companies including Govini&nbsp;and Palantir&nbsp;are behind the production and modernization of today's most high-tech weapon systems. Both companies were at the second annual AI Expo for National Competitiveness in Washington to showcase their work to the nation’s top military brass. Fox News saw first-hand this cutting-edge technology and had an exclusive interview with Palantir's CEO and co-founder Alex Karp, whose software is being used in Ukraine and the Middle East. ""The way to prevent a war with China is to ramp up not just Palantir, but defense tech startups that produce software-defining weapons systems that scare the living F out of our adversaries,"" Karp said. Karp emphasized either the U.S. will win the race for AI, or Russia and China will. FREAK ROBOT MADE IN CHINA CAN LEARN, THINK, WORK LIKE HUMANS Fear that AI could lead to killer robots and take humans out of the so-called ""kill chain"" has led to anxiety and threats of regulation that worries American innovators. But the U.S. has been ahead of its adversaries in artificial intelligence, and Karp said he wanted to keep it that way to deter any wrongdoing. ""Our adversaries have a long tradition of being not interested in the rule of law, not interested in fairness, not interested in human rights and on the battlefield. It really is going to be us or them. …&nbsp;You do not want a world order where our adversaries try to define new norms. It would be very bad for the world, and it would be especially bad for America,"" Karp explained. Fox News had the opportunity to look at some of the latest cutting-edge technology. Mixed Reality Command and Control goggles allow the war fighter to see the battlefield, available air assets, enemy targets and supply routes in 3D. Former intelligence analyst Shannon Clark, who has since led research and development for Palantir, said this targeting technology would have helped shorten the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, possibly leading to different outcomes. Clark guided Fox News through four different demonstrations showing how the different technology worked and how U.S. generals could use it to make critical decisions in real time. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? ""It's about speed. What was able to be done in days or weeks is now done in minutes,"" Clark said. As drone swarms have become more prominent in modern warfare, knowing exactly what weapons the U.S. had in its stockpiles would be critical to defending U.S. interests across the globe. &nbsp; ""I had a general say to me the other day, 'It doesn't matter if I have 50 targets. I need to know what ammo I have available,'"" Clark said. Maverick is an AI-generated target effector. Clark explained how it worked: ""Here's your list of targets. Here's the priority with which you want to action those targets. And, then, here's the effect that you should use in order to take action"

""When you literally have people's hands making some of these technologies, you innovate across the supply chain."" ""You'll innovate the manufacturing equipment that's used in the fabs, you'll innovate how to operate the fabs, you'll innovate the design of the chips,"" Klamkin said. ""The U.S. needs to be vertically integrated in semiconductors. We can't just design the chips and write the software code."" The U.S. faces competition from rival nations for the possession of the kinds of chips necessary to power the research and development of AI models.

SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM CRACKS DOWN ON ADS FOR ‘AI GIRLFRIENDS’ The tightening supply with the high demand has pushed countries to seek out simpler chips to make up for the lack of more advanced chips and a stockpiling effort between companies.&nbsp; Gregory C. Allen, the director of the Wadhwani Center for AI and Advanced Technologies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, previously told Fox News Digital that AI ""is the hottest category in global venture capital markets and technology investment."" ""Many different companies are being created to pursue AI technology, and so many major technology giants are remaking themselves around AI technology, especially after the more recent breakthroughs in generative AI and foundation models,"" Allen said.&nbsp; Part of the problem comes from the fact that the U.S. does not produce much of the global supply of chips. As of the passage of the CHIPS Act in 2022, the U.S. produced 12% of the advanced chips, compared to 37% in the 1990s; Taiwan produces the vast majority of advanced chips while China seeks to rapidly expand its manufacturing capabilities.

20240506,cnn,Warren Buffett compares AI to nuclear weapons in stark warning,"Warren Buffett is worried about artificial intelligence. At his annual shareholder meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, the 93 year-old co-founder, chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway issued a stark warning about the potential dangers of the technology. “We let a genie out of the bottle when we developed nuclear weapons,” he said Saturday. “AI is somewhat similar — it’s part way out of the bottle.” The so-called Oracle of Omaha acknowledged to his audience that he has little idea about the tech behind AI, but said he still fears its potential repercussions. His image and voice were recently replicated by an AI-backed tool, he said, and they were so convincing that they could have fooled his own family. Scams using these deep fakes, he added, will likely become increasingly prevalent. “If I was interested in investing in scamming, it’s going to be the growth industry of all time,” he told the crowd. Berkshire Hathaway has started employing some AI in its own business to make employees more efficient, said Greg Abel, the expected successor to Buffett who runs Berkshire’s non-insurance operations, on Saturday. “At times it displaces the labor, but then hopefully, there’s other opportunities,” said Abel, who didn’t reveal much detail about how the company plans to use AI. Buffett also acknowledged that the technology could change the world for the better, but said he isn’t sold yet. “It has enormous potential for good and enormous potential for harm,” he said. “And I just don’t know how that plays out.” The AI explosion has already transformed workplaces across the world and nearly 40% of global employment could be disrupted by AI, according to the International Monetary Fund. Industries from medicine to finance to music have already felt its effects. Shares of companies associated with the AI boom have soared. Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) is up about 215% over the last 12 months, while Microsoft (MSFT) is up about 34%. Shares of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A), have increased by 22% over the same period. Not just Buffett Buffett isn’t the only major business figure expressing concern about AI scamming. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said in his annual shareholder letter last month that while he doesn’t yet know the full effect AI will have on business, the economy or society, he knows its influence will be significant. “We are completely convinced the consequences will be extraordinary and possibly as transformational as some of the major technological inventions of the past several hundred years: Think the printing press, the steam engine, electricity, computing and the Internet, among others,” the JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO wrote in the letter. Dimon also recognized the risks that come with the AI boom. “You may already be aware that there are bad actors using AI to try to infiltrate companies’ systems to steal money and intellectual property or simply to cause disruption and damage,” he wrote.
