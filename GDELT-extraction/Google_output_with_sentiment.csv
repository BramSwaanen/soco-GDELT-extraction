20240429,cnn,Manufacturing in Mexico is having its moment. The US is buying in — and so is China,"As US supply chains decouple from China, Mexico’s manufacturing sector is emerging as a winner. Manufacturing in Mexico is attractive for companies that experienced pandemic-era supply chain snarls or want to decrease reliance on trade between the US and China amid geopolitical uncertainty. That’s called nearshoring, which is when companies bring production facilities closer to home markets. As nearshoring continues and global supply chains are reorganized, Mexico’s manufacturing sector has an opportunity for long-term success, according to Alberto Ramos, head of Latin American economics research at Goldman Sachs, who spoke with CNN. Ramos said Mexico and China have been competing for the US manufacturing market for years, but amid a shifting US-China relationship, Mexico looks poised to pull ahead. Mexico surpassed China as the top exporter to the US in 2023. Those exports were driven by manufacturing, which comprises 40% of Mexico’s economy, according to Morgan Stanley. US imports from Mexico continued to increase in February, according to April 4 trade data released by the Commerce Department. Meanwhile, Chinese exports to the US were down 20% in 2023, compared to 2022. US Trade Representative Katherine Tai told CNN’s Julia Chatterley that supply chains have made the US economy over-reliant on the Chinese economy in the past. “The challenge for us is how do you create more resilience in your economy and in trade? Because right now, the way trade has been operating, our supply chains have been so entangled and they have created so much concentration in the Chinese economy, that we all feel extremely vulnerable because the supply chains are fragile,” Tai said. Amid shifting geopolitics and competition, US and Chinese companies both see potential in Mexican manufacturing: Low labor costs, geographic proximity to American markets and the US-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) agreement — a free trade accord established in 2020 that makes trade in North America more cost-effective and efficient — are all factors contributing to a potential boom. Made in where? While US policy intends to decrease reliance on China and “create more resilience” in US trade, moving supply chains can be tricky. In fact, the US drive to disengage from the Chinese economy might be enabling China  to access new markets and avoid US tariffs. Cars are a major export for Mexico, and they illustrate much of what’s happening. Mexico is a global hub for car factories, hosting plants from major companies operating in the US, including General Motors, Ford, Stellantis and nearly a dozen more. Virtually every American auto manufacturer depends on parts from Mexico to build its cars or trucks, because those parts can be substantially cheaper than those made in the US. Free trade agreements like the USMCA mean companies in the US, Mexico and Canada face fewer barriers moving, selling and buying parts across North America. A diversion from free trade is tariff policy: In 2018, the US hiked tariffs on imports from China, which makes it more expensive for Chinese goods to enter US markets and dissuades companies from relying on Chinese supply chains. Cars require tens of thousands of parts, which can be made in any number of places. And while Mexico’s manufacturing sector is increasing exports to the US, Chinese companies might be using Mexico as a route to avoid US tariffs on Chinese goods, according to Xeneta, an ocean freight rate benchmarking and market intelligence platform. Shipping container exports from China to Mexico were up nearly 60% in January compared to a year ago, according to Container Trade Statistics analyzed by Xeneta. The surge in exports from China to Mexico suggests the possibility “that the increase in trade we are witnessing is due to importers trying to circumvent US tariffs,” Peter Sand, chief analyst at Xeneta, wrote in a March 15 research note. An April report by Moody’s Analytics said that while Mexico has increased its manufacturing output, production may be boosted by goods manufactured outside of the country. The increase in Mexican exports to the US has “been roughly matched by simultaneous and closely correlated growth in Mexican imports from China,” according to S&P Global Market Intelligence country risk analysts Jose Enrique Sevilla-Macip and John Raines. Goldman’s Ramos said there is an economic incentive to move production to Mexico to avoid tariffs. “It’s a way to circumvent the policy objectives that were behind the enactment of tariffs,” he told CNN. On Capitol Hill, the possibility that Chinese steel is ducking US tariffs has garnered attention from lawmakers. The Biden administration announced that it is working with the Mexican government to prevent China and other countries from evading US tariffs on steel and aluminum via US imports from Mexico. As early as February, Tai inquired about “the lack of transparency” around Mexico’s steel and aluminum imports from “third countries” during a meeting with Raquel Buenrostro, Mexico’s secretary of economy. Concerns of tariff evasion are drawing a response from the US president — and will continue to beyond November’s election. The USMCA is set to be reviewed in 2026. Both US President Joe Biden and his challenger, former President Donald Trump, espouse goals to grow domestic manufacturing, but they diverge on how to go about doing so. Biden told steelworkers in Pittsburgh recently that the US government should consider tripling tariffs on Chinese steel. And Trump has proposed a potential 60% tariff on Chinese goods if he returns to the presidency. “With both US presidential candidates vying to win important Midwestern swing states that have significant auto industries, the issue of US-Mexico-China trade will only increase as the 2024 presidential campaign unfolds,” S&P Global’s Sevilla-Macip and Raines said. A gradual shift While supply chains are shifting, moving factories isn’t always that simple. It can take significant investment, from time to money to people. The companies that are moving forward, though, are creating long-term opportunities for the Mexican manufacturing industry. “It certainly feels like things are booming in Monterrey,” a city in northern Mexico, said Christoffer Enemaerke, a portfolio manager at RBC. On a recent trip there, he told CNN, “we met with companies and experts in the real estate industry and the feedback was that nearshoring is likely to be a multi-year driver of growth for Mexico, particularly in the northern part of the country.” Tesla (TSLA), for example, said last year that it would build a new plant in Monterrey. “We’re super excited about it,” CEO Elon Musk said during an investor day for the company, adding that the plant would add capacity, rather than replace capacity elsewhere. Sentiment on the ground is exciting, but most investment flows are yet to be seen,  Ramos told CNN. Analysts at Morgan Stanley see the value of Mexico’s exports to the United States growing from $455 billion to about $609 billion in the next five years. That also makes Mexico an attractive base for many Chinese companies. EV maker BYD, a global competitor to Musk’s Tesla, announced in February plans for a major expansion in Mexico. While BYD doesn’t currently sell cars in the US market, a move to Mexico would provide better access to the Mexican market while preparing the company for a potential move into the US. “Chinese investment and exports to Mexico are highly likely to become a headline issue ahead of the 2026 scheduled review of the USMCA,” Sevilla-Macip and Raines said. Until then, though, places like Monterrey continue to reap the rewards. Monterrey, said RBC’s Enemaerke, “feels booming, new and vibrant, more so than other industrial cities I’ve been to, which have mainly been in Asia.” CNN’s Michael Nam contributed to this report.",0.061000000685453415,22.70400047302246
20240429,nbcnews,Elon Musk makes surprise visit to Beijing as Tesla's China-made cars pass data security rules,"BEIJING — Local Chinese authorities have removed restrictions on Tesla cars after the company’s China-made vehicles passed the country’s data security requirements, the automaker said Sunday. The breakthrough came as Tesla CEO Elon Musk arrived in Beijing for an unexpected meeting with Chinese Premier Li Qiang, amid the first major auto show in the city in four years. Although Tesla’s electric cars are some of the most popular vehicles in China, they have reportedly been banned from some government-related properties due to concerns about what data the U.S.-based automaker can collect. Tesla’s news release did not specify which local authorities had removed restrictions on the cars. The Biden administration earlier this year announced an investigation into whether imported cars from China pose national security risks due to their ability to potentially collect data about the U.S. and send it back to China. Tesla’s vehicles were not the only ones that passed the data security rules. In addition to Tesla’s Model 3 and Model Y, several new energy vehicles from BYD, Lotus, Nezha, Li Auto and Nio passed China’s data security requirements, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers and the National Computer Network Emergency Response Technical Team/Coordination Center of China said Sunday. The new data security requirements for “connected vehicles” were released in November and cover cars released in 2022 and 2023 which automakers voluntarily submit for inspection, the center said. The rules test for whether the cars anonymize facial recognition data outside the vehicle, default to not collecting cockpit data, process that data inside the car and prominently notify users of personal information processing. Tesla was included in the first batch of automakers that met the data compliance requirements. Tesla said in its news release that it localized data storage in 2021 at its Shanghai data center, and passed the ISO 27001 international standard for information security after a review by third-party auditors. Musk’s visit to China on Sunday also raised expectations that Tesla’s driver-assist software Full Self Driving would soon be available in the country. However, JL Warren Capital CEO and Head of Research Junheng Li said on X that the rollout of a “supervised” version of FSD in China is “extremely unlikely.” She pointed to challenges for Tesla to support local operation of the software as a foreign entity in China. Li said there’s “no strategic value” for Beijing to support FSD’s domestic rollout when there are many high-quality local alternatives, such as Xpeng’s driver-assist software. Premier Li visited Xpeng and other companies at the Beijing auto show on Sunday, and called for innovation and demand to drive production, according to state media. Tesla is not exhibiting at this year’s auto show, as has been the case since a protester stood on one of its cars during the auto show in Shanghai in 2021. The show alternates between Beijing and Shanghai on an annual basis, and wasn’t held in 2022 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.",0.0689999982714653,7.2220001220703125
20240429,cnn,The longest commercial passenger flight from China will take you to Mexico City,"China Southern Airlines is launching its first-ever direct passenger flight from the megacity of Shenzhen to Mexico City, which will set the record as the longest nonstop regular commercial flight to originate in China. The flight will cover an intercontinental distance of around 14,147 kilometers (8,790 miles) in each direction. The inaugural flight will depart from the Chinese southern metropolis of Shenzhen on May 11, making a 16-hour nonstop journey to Mexico City, according to information available from China Southern Airlines. The flight will depart on Tuesdays and Saturdays. Flying the other way around is a little more grueling, with an estimated flight time of 21 hours and 20 minutes. It will begin service on Wednesdays and Sundays from May 12. The slightly longer route to China includes a brief refueling stopover at Tijuana, during which passengers have to stay on board. The roundtrip journey uses the flight code CZ8031/2 and will be serviced by Airbus A350 aircraft, according to reporting from SZ News, a state-affiliate news outlet based in Shenzhen. The upcoming route overtakes China Southern Airlines’ Guangzhou to New York flight, which covers a distance of 12,871 kilometers, as the furthest nonstop commercial flight to depart from a Chinese airport. Currently, the 15,332 kilometer Singapore to New York route operated by Singapore Airlines claims the top spot as the world’s longest nonstop flight, which runs around 19 hours in each direction. China Southern Airline’s newest route would knock out Singapore Airlines’ Singapore to Los Angeles flight to take 8th place on the list of the world’s longest flights compiled by aviation analytics database OAG. Last year, China reopened its borders to travelers for the first time since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in early 2020. Airlines have since been restoring flight routes that were halted or greatly reduced during the pandemic, particularly long-haul legs to the United States and all over Europe. China Southern Airlines was the first-ever Chinese carrier to operate flights to Mexico, launching the Guangzhou-Vancouver-Mexico City route in April 2017, according to reports from Chinese state media agency Xinhua at the time.",0.14499999582767487,3.5199999809265137

She spoke on the sidelines of the AmCham Business Summit after meeting Kenyan President William Ruto during her first official trip to Africa. Anti-Western sentiment Like many other African nations, Kenya has deep ties with China, which has funding projects and major infrastructure projects across the continent. Russia is also making fresh inroads into the continent, capitalizing on anti-Western sentiment in some nations to profit from arms sales and natural resources. Secretary Raimondo addressed the criticism that African nations dislike ‘lectures’ from the US and its European allies about democracy and human rights, and many prefer dealing with China or Russia that don’t make similar demands. Raimondo said the US is coming to Africa “without strings attached,” saying she had brought more than a dozen businesses to the Nairobi summit. “I just met with President Ruto, and we had a fantastic meeting.

20240429,cbsnews,San Diego Zoo will receive two new giant pandas from China after nearly all pandas in U.S. were returned,"After nearly all of the giant pandas on loan at U.S. zoos were returned to China, the San Diego Zoo has announced they will get two new pandas from the country. They are expected to arrive this summer.The San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance announced Sunday that its care team leaders visited China and met two giant pandas – Yun Chuan and Xin Bao, who will be cared for at the California zoo.Yun Chuan is almost 5 years old and is the grandson of Bai Yun, who lived at the San Diego Zoo for 23 years, the zoo said in a news release. His name is a combination of his grandmother's and the province where he came from, Chuan. Xin Bao is almost four years old and, like Yun Chuan, was born at China's Wolong Shenshuping Panda Base. The name Xin Bao means ""new treasure of prosperity and abundance,"" and the zoo describes her as ""a gentle and witty introvert with a sweet round face and big ears.""""Our conservation partners in China shared photographs and personality traits of Yun Chuan and Xin Bao, but meeting them in person was so special,"" said Dr. Megan Owen, vice president of conservation science at San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance.

Under the agreement, the Smithsonian National Zoo, Atlanta Zoo, Memphis Zoo and San Diego Zoo all received pandas and worked with China on research and conservation projects.The agreement with the zoos was extended several times. In 1987, San Diego received two pandas for a 100-day visit, but eventually signed a 12-year agreement and received two pandas, named Bai Yun and Shi Shi, in 1996. The agreement kept getting extended and a total of six pandas were born at the zoo.

In 2023, their agreement ended and the zoo returned two pandas Mei Xiang and Tian Tian, who had been at the zoo since 2000, and their baby Xiao Qi Ji, who was born in 2020.The Atlanta Zoo is the only zoo in the U.S. to still have pandas on loan from China, but their agreement, which was put in place in the mid-1990s, expires in 2024 and they are expected to return their pandas Lun Lun and Yang Yang and their offspring, Ya Lun and Xi Lun by the end of the year.The San Diego Zoo said it met with conservation partners from the China Wildlife Conservation Association to discuss research and conservation programs. Over the past 30 years, the zoo has partnered with conservation institutions in China to study the reproductive behavior, physiology, nutritional requirements, habitat needs and genetics of pandas. The zoo even developed a panda milk formula, which, along with other research, has helped increase survival rates of baby pandas from 5% to 95%. They also completed the first successful artificial insemination of a giant panda outside of China. ""Our partnership over the decades has served as a powerful example of how, when we work together, we can achieve what was once thought to be impossible,"" said Owen.

20240429,foxnews,"South Korean opposition leader pushes president to accept investigation of wife, top officials","Emboldened by his party’s recent election win, South Korea’s opposition leader pressured President Yoon Suk Yeol to accept special investigations into allegations involving top officials and his wife, as they met Monday for talks on bipartisan cooperation. The meeting was their first since Yoon took office in 2022 after defeating Lee Jae-myung in the country’s closest presidential election race. During their 2022 campaigns, Yoon, Lee and their supporters demonized each other and filed dozens of lawsuits against one another. Yoon proposed the meeting as he faces growing calls to cooperate with Lee’s Democratic Party, whose victory in the April 10 parliamentary election allows it to extend its control of the single-chamber National Assembly until after Yoon’s single five-year term ends in 2027. NORTH KOREA ISSUES NUCLEAR 'WARNING SIGNAL' TO US, SOUTH KOREA In his lengthy opening remarks, Lee said the election results mean ""the people’s stern demand for correcting wrong government administrations,"" addressing economic troubles and restoring democratic rules.  Lee urged Yoon to accept independent probes into the 2022 Halloween crush in Seoul that killed 159 people, and the 2023 death of a marine who drowned during a search-and-rescue operation for flood victims. Lee’s party has accused Yoon of ignoring public demands and retaining top officials and military commanders responsible for the deadly incidents. Lee also asked Yoon to resolve ""diverse suspicions involving his family"" that ""poses a big burden on government operations."" That was apparently a reference to first lady Kim Keon Hee, who faces an allegation of involvement in a stock price manipulation and other scandals. ""I’d say it would be good for you, as president, to respect the National Assembly and consider the opposition party as a partner for government operations,"" Lee said. KIM JONG UN THREATENS ATTACKING, 'OCCUPYING' SOUTH KOREA IN EVENT OF CONFLICT While listening to Lee's statement, Yoon nodded several times and said he had expected Lee to make such comments but didn’t elaborate. In a briefing after the meeting, senior presidential adviser Lee Do-woon said that Yoon told Lee that he won’t oppose a special law to investigate the Halloween deaths but noted some potential legal concerns over an ad-hoc investigation committee. He didn’t mention Yoon’s responses to demands for other probes. During the meeting, Lee also asked Yoon to accept his contentious idea of the government giving about $180 to all South Koreans as a way to boost the economy, a step that Yoon’s party has called a populist measure. Lee Do-woon, the presidential adviser, said Yoon said that he prefers selectively supporting those in need. In a separate briefing, Democratic Party spokesperson Park Sung-joon accused Yoon of lacking the resolve to revive public livelihoods. Park cited Lee as suggesting he was disappointed at the meeting’s results though the start of direct communication with Yoon would still be meaningful. No agreement was reached, but Yoon’s office said the president and Lee agreed to meet frequently without setting a date for their next meeting. In one positive news for bipartisan cooperation, Lee told Yoon that his party would support the government’s high-stakes push to increase medical school students, which prompted thousands of young doctors to walk out of the job in February. The government recently suggested it’s open to halving its target medical school enrollment increase to 1,000 per year from the previously proposed 2,000, but doctors say they can’t accept any increase in students. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Yoon has said South Korea needs to create more doctors as it has one of the world’s most rapidly aging populations and its doctors-to-patient ratio is among the lowest in advanced economies. Doctors say schools can’t deal with a too steep increase in students, but critics say they simply worry the supply of more doctors would eventually result in lowering their income. The parliamentary election was seen as a litmus test of Yoon, who has been struggling with low approval rating and an opposition-controlled parliament that has limited his policy agenda since his inauguration. Critics say the election defeat was largely attributable to the government’s failure to suppress rising prices and other economic problems and Yoon’s personal management and leadership styles. Despite the election defeat, Yoon’s major foreign policy agendas will likely remain unchanged as they mostly don’t require parliamentary endorsements. Yoon has pushed hard to boost trilateral cooperation with the United States and Japan to cope with North Korea’s evolving nuclear threats and other challenges.",-0.22200000286102295,9.564000129699707
20240429,foxnews,5 China threats the US can't afford to ignore,"The threats from the Chinese Communist Party continue to grow. From the market manipulation that is hurting American industry, to the fentanyl crisis ravaging our communities, and the persistent military threats against our partners and allies, the CCP has shown why Democrats and Republicans must continue to come together to oppose its malign activities. As Chairman of the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, here are five key areas where I believe the United States must focus our efforts to resist Beijing. 1. Safeguarding Taiwan and America’s allies In February, I traveled to Taiwan with Select Committee Ranking Member Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., and other members of the committee. The meetings and on-the-ground experience there reinforced the urgent need to ramp up our defense industrial base to meet the challenges posed by the CCP’s growing military ambitions. The trip also made clear that we cannot assume economic measures alone will deter the Chinese military from invading Taiwan. We need to expand training programs for Taiwan’s military and eliminate bottlenecks that have left Taiwan waiting years to receive the weapons it needs to defend itself.&nbsp; CHINA THREATENS RETALIATION FOR TAIWAN, TIKTOK LAW SIGNED BY BIDEN 2. Stopping the CCP from flooding our communities with fentanyl China produces 97% of the world’s supply of fentanyl precursors, and as a bipartisan report from the Select Committee found earlier this month, the CCP shockingly subsidizes fentanyl exports and even warns traffickers about upcoming crackdowns by U.S. law enforcement. As a result, the CCP is not only complicit in the fentanyl crisis, but is the active source in this epidemic which kills nearly 100,000 Americans annually. We need to apply maximum pressure against the Chinese companies that produce fentanyl precursors and the Chinese officials that enable&nbsp;them.&nbsp;  3. Preventing the CCP from dominating key parts of the global economy  The CCP’s ambitions pose a threat to the world economy. In particular, the CCP has sought to dominate key supply chains in order to bend other countries to its will. Unfortunately, many of our nation’s critical supply chains are dependent on China, including electric vehicles and rare earth minerals.&nbsp; BILLIONS IN US INVESTMENT GOES TO CHINESE FIRMS LINKED TO CCP MILITARY, HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES China already produces nearly 60% of the world’s lithium batteries, and rather than rebuilding our own domestic capacity, state and federal policies are incentivizing Chinese firms to use our own tax dollars for their U.S. ambitions. One of those Chinese companies is CATL, a firm that receives massive subsidies from the CCP, and which has party cells operating throughout the company. Now, as China floods markets around the world with cheap EVs, U.S. automakers are feeling the pressure to keep up and they are looking at partnerships with CATL.  We cannot trade American economic leadership for technology and supply chains controlled by Beijing. 4. Countering the CCP’s malign influence here at home  The CCP has set its sights on communities across America, including in my home-state of Michigan. One example of this is Gotion, a subsidiary of China-based Gotion High Tech which pledges allegiance to the CCP. Gotion is trying to build a battery component factory in my district, and numerous concerns have been raised over the past year and half.&nbsp; There was even bipartisan agreement in January, when Leon Panetta and Mike Pompeo – former CIA directors for Presidents Obama and Trump, respectively – both testified about the dangers of allowing CCP-affiliated companies to build production lines in our country.&nbsp; &nbsp;CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION These facilities grow U.S. dependence on Chinese technology, and could be used for other nefarious activities. Not only is the CCP using its economic leverage against us, but it is also intimidating, harassing, and influencing people on U.S. soil. The CCP has operated illegal police stations across the country to punish anyone who speaks out against it.  5. Resisting the CCP’s propaganda The CCP seeks to influence our politicians, business leaders, and now our youth. Through TikTok and its algorithm, the CCP is able to manipulate what millions of young Americans see and do not see.&nbsp; CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In the past year, TikTok has promoted pro-Hamas content, convinced many Americans Usama bin Laden was admirable, and even forced&nbsp;children&nbsp;to call members of Congress when the House took action to protect Americans from the threat of TikTok.&nbsp; Our nation’s founding principles are the heart of our national strength and we need to leverage them to make a clear contrast between the U.S. and the CCP. Under my leadership, the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party will continue to work in a bipartisan manner to hold the CCP accountable for its military, economic, and ideological aggression against America and our allies. This is a competition we must win. Republican John Moolenaar represents Michigan's 2nd district in the United States House of Representatives where he serves as chairman of the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party.",-0.49799999594688416,25.538999557495117

20240430,cnn,Samsung reports enormous jump in profit on AI boom,"Samsung Electronics forecast demand for artificial intelligence would hold strong and tighten supply of some high-end chips, joining rivals in benefiting from a solid rebound in the battered global memory chip market. The upbeat outlook from the world’s largest memory chip maker sent its shares 1.8% higher on Tuesday after it reported a more than 10-fold rise in first-quarter operating profit. But so far this year Samsung shares are down 0.8%, lagging SK Hynix’s 24% gain, as it seeks to catch up with its smaller rival in the supply of top-end chips such as high bandwidth memory (HBM) to AI leader Nvidia (NVDA). “We plan to increase supply of HBM-related chips in 2024 by more than three-fold versus last year,” Jaejune Kim, a Samsung vice president in charge of the memory division, said on an earnings call. Samsung said it began mass production this month of the latest HBM chips for use in generative AI chipsets, called 8-layer HBM3E. It is seeking to capitalize on the AI boom that has benefited SK Hynix, which had been the sole supplier of HBM3 chips to Nvidia. Samsung said it planned to start making the 12-layer version during the second quarter, and expected the latest HBM3E products to account for two-thirds of its HBM output by year-end. Analysts said the targets were aggressive. Samsung’s 8-layer HBM3E appears to be supplying Nvidia, while the 12-layer may go to AMD (AMD) and Nvidia, said Jeff Kim, head of research at KB Securities. “As Samsung’s technology is advantageous for high-stacking, while SK Hynix has its advantages in the 8-layer, there may be a segmentation where Nvidia gets 12-layer products from Samsung and most 8-layer products from SK Hynix,” Kim said. “Samsung is working hard to improve the yield of its 12-layer product,” he added. Samsung did not respond immediately to a request for comment on its HBM customers. Samsung also said it will step up offerings of high-end solid-state drive (SSD) products to meet AI server demand, and expected high-end memory chip supply to become tighter toward year-end due to capacity being focused on HBM, echoing comments from SK Hynix last week. Jump in operating profit The South Korean company’s first-quarter revenue rose 13% to 71.9 trillion won ($52.14 billion), including a 96% increase in memory chip revenue to 17.49 trillion won as prices rose steeply from a severe downturn, partly thanks to the boom in AI. Operating profit rose to 6.6 trillion won in January to March, up from 640 billion won a year earlier. It was the company’s highest operating profit since the third quarter of 2022. The chip division, historically Samsung’s cash cow business that used to account for two-thirds of its operating profit, swung to a profit of 1.91 trillion won in the March quarter from a 4.58 trillion won loss a year earlier. It was the first profit since the third quarter of 2022. Prices of NAND flash chips used to store data increased by 23% to 28% during the first quarter versus the previous quarter, while prices of DRAM chips used in tech devices rose by about 20%, according to data provider TrendForce. Samsung’s mobile devices business booked a 3.51 trillion won operating profit in the first quarter, down from 3.94 trillion won a year earlier. It shipped about 60 million smartphones during the quarter, in line with a year earlier but retaking its title as the world’s top smartphone vendor from Apple (AAPL), which is suffering a sales decline in China. Rising costs, including increased memory chip prices, dented margins from its flagship Galaxy S24 smartphones launched during the quarter. Samsung said AI functions were driving sales of S24 phones, allowing the division to maintain double-digit profitability in the first quarter. About 50% of customers said they bought S24 phones for the AI functions, and 60% were regularly using the AI functions, the company said.",0.23000000417232513,10.217000007629395
20240430,cnn,"Chinese water cannon damages ship in new South China Sea flare-up, Philippines says","China’s coast guard fired water cannons that damaged a Philippine vessel on Tuesday, marking the latest flare-up of violence between the two countries in the disputed South China Sea, Philippine authorities said. The Philippine Coast Guard said the incident occurred as one of its ships and a fisheries agency vessel carried out a “legitimate patrol” near Scarborough Shoal, a Chinese-controlled rocky outcrop 130 miles (200 kilometers) west of the main Philippine island of Luzon and inside Manila’s exclusive economic zone. Video supplied by the Philippine Coast Guard showed two larger Chinese vessels firing water cannons from opposite sides of the Philippine ship. “The Philippine vessels encountered dangerous maneuvers and obstruction from four China Coast Guard vessels and six Chinese Maritime Militia vessels,” Philippine Coast Guard spokesperson Commodore Jay Tarriela said in the statement. The Philippine Coast Guard ship suffered “damage to the railing and canopy,” according to its statement. No injuries were reported. In a post on social platform Weibo Tuesday, the China Coast Guard said it had expelled the Philippine vessels for “intruding” into the waters, “in accordance with the law.” Beijing asserts ownership over almost all of the South China Sea in defiance of an international court ruling. Over the past two decades, China has occupied a number of obscure reefs and atolls far from its shoreline across the South China Sea, building up military installations, including runways and ports. Scarborough Shoal, which China calls Huangyan Island and is also known as Bajo de Masinloc, is a small but strategic reef and fertile fishing ground. There are no structures on the shoal, but China has maintained a continuous coast guard presence around it since 2012, according to the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative. The Philippines also said Tuesday that China had reinstalled a 380-meter (1,247-feet) floating barrier that “covers the entire entrance of the shoal, effectively restricting access to the area.” Scarborough Shoal is one of several disputed islands and reefs in the South China Sea, which have long been a flashpoint of territorial disputes between the two nations. In March, Chinese coast guard ships fired water cannons against a Philippine vessel on a resupply mission to a contingent of Filipino marines on another contested South China Sea feature, Second Thomas Shoal, causing “heavy damages.” That shoal sits about 200 kilometers (125 miles) from the coast of the Philippine island of Palawan. In the 1990s the Philippines grounded an aging World War II-era transport ship called the BRP Sierra Madre on the shoal, to help enforce its claim to the area. The ship is now mostly a rusted wreckage and is staffed by marines stationed on rotation. Following that incident, the China Coast Guard said on Weibo it had taken “control measures in accordance with the law” against the Philippine vessels, which it said had “illegally entered the waters adjacent to Ren’ai Reef,” as Beijing calls Second Thomas Shoal. Earlier in March, Chinese water cannon hit a Philippine resupply boat as it headed to Second Thomas Shoal, shattering windows and injuring four Filipino sailors. Beijing and Manila’s South China Sea disputes have heated up since the 2022 election of Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who has taken a stronger line against China than his predecessor Rodrigo Duterte. The clashes have also raised fears they could lead to a wider conflict, as Manila maintains a mutual defense treaty with the United States, which Washington says covers Philippine vessels in the disputed waterway.",-0.21299999952316284,5.322999954223633

20240430,nbcnews,This Boston preschool is teaching children in Creole and English — and instilling Haitian pride,"In the heart of Boston’s Mattapan neighborhood, a quiet revolution is taking place at the Mattahunt Elementary School, whose Toussaint L’Ouverture Dual Language Academy is not just breaking down language barriers but  also fostering pride, empowerment and a deep connection to Haitian culture among its students. It’s the first two-way immersion Haitian Creole dual-language preschool program in the country, and it’s fitting that it operates in Boston, the city with the third-largest Haitian population in America. Priscilla Joseph, a founding teacher of the academy, said it was created in 2017 to meet the needs of the surrounding Creole-speaking neighborhood.  “Boston Public Schools and many community partners felt that the Mattahunt would be the best location, especially in Mattapan, which has a high Haitian population,” said Joseph, who leads the K-5 program at the school. Mattahunt Elementary School accommodates 512 students, while the Toussaint L’Ouvertue Dual Language Academy — named for the leader of the Haitian Revolution — serves 132 students. The school boasts a 97% enrollment of students of color, predominantly Black.  Joseph, who is Haitian American, said she draws from her own experiences as she passionately advocates for the importance of preserving Haitian Creole. “I also grew up in a place where it wasn’t OK to say that you were Haitian, and there was a lot of discrimination against Haitian people,” she said. “So I kind of took my own experiences and entered that into the classroom, knowing how it feels to be a little bit different, or a little bit outcasted, because of your culture.” One common experience for many children of immigrants is having to translate and advocate for their families and parents from an early age. The academy not only helps children in that regard, but also tries to knock down some language barriers to steer parents and relatives away from feeling isolated.  “We do have staff who are also Creole speakers, like our social worker, who speaks Haitian Creole,” Joseph said. “Some of our other admins speak Haitian Creole, and our family liaison speaks Haitian Creole. So when they are looking for different things, such as help with filling out applications, we’ve had some of our social workers and our family liaison go to the Welcome Center and help them fill out applications,” Joseph said. Now, parents who speak only Creole can actively engage in their children’s education thanks to genuine diversity.  A typical school day at the Mattahunt Elementary Dual Language program is structured to provide students with a comprehensive and balanced education in both Haitian Creole and English. Students engage in a variety of activities that promote bilingualism and biliteracy, as well as sociocultural competency. The curriculum is designed to align with students’ interests, contexts and cultures, creating a meaningful learning experience that resonates with them. One of the key features of the program is the application of English and Haitian Creole to all subjects, including Language Arts, Math, Science and Social Studies. For example, students learn the Haitian alphabet, explore Haitian folklore and study stories that relate to their home culture. This not only enhances their language skills but also helps them make meaningful connections to their heritage and identity.  Their journey to build the program began beyond the school walls, all the way in Haiti, where Joseph, Henderson and a group of educators from Mattahunt sought inspiration and guidance from educators and communities alike.  While “it was great to be a tourist,” Joseph said, the main objective was to talk to teachers and students at several different types of schools. “One of the biggest things the teachers talked about was that they could not believe that there were little kids in Boston learning Haitian Creole,” she said.   Witnessing the resilience and pride of the Haitian people firsthand, they said they returned with a renewed sense of purpose and determination to instill the same pride in their students. That pride filters down even into celebrating Haitian Heritage Month with author readings, cultural performances and flag-raising ceremonies. Joseph described the annual tradition of raising the Haitian flag atop the school as a powerful symbol of unity and pride. Addressing concerns about negative portrayals of Haiti in the media during the current crisis, Joseph and Walter Henderson, the principal of Mattahunt Elementary School, emphasized the importance of instilling resilience and positivity in their students. “We show them videos of Haiti, we show them the music, and we remind them of Haiti’s rich history and legacy of resilience,” Joseph explained. Henderson said he and the other teachers in the academy envision their work as educating Haiti’s future leaders. Haiti’s “next ambassador, president, engineers, lawyers and doctors,” could come from his classrooms, Henderson said. “We’re just prepping them for when they take over. And we try to make sure that they understand that Haiti is a powerful nation.” As the program continues to flourish, it serves as a beacon of hope and empowerment for Haitian American students and their families, challenging stereotypes and fostering a sense of belonging and pride. This program is not just transforming education at one elementary school in a Boston neighborhood, Henderson said. It’s changing lives and building a brighter future for generations to come. Test scores show that students are performing well, but perhaps just as importantly, that what the children are learning is “bringing a sense of comfort to the families.” For more from NBC BLK, sign up for our weekly newsletter.",0.5590000152587891,23.889999389648438
